certain acute cases also if the body ought to be depleted and at the same time the patient's strength does not admit of cutting a vein and cupping as it is a less severe remedy so it is a safer one

itself after it has become relaxed."], [["Nam et adstringitur aliquid eo dempto quod interpositum ut id laxaretur effecerat et mollitur eo detracto quod duritiem creabat et inpletur non ipsa frictione

on alternate days yet if the system is weak it should be given every day and far more so if the fevers continue without remissions inasmuch as they distress the patient more or when two or more paroxysms occur on the same day."], [["Quae res efficit ut et a\u00a0primo die protinus civ dari cotidie debeat si protinus venae conciderunt et saepius eodem die si inter plures accessiones subinde

discharged but also that it is tending into another part of the body.", "But if the fistula is in the flesh and is recent and simple and is not tortuous or in a cavity or joint but in a part which

of wool twisted into the shape of a tent.", "Squills boiled and mixed with quicklime also eat away callus.", "If however the fistula is longer but runs crosswise it is best to insert a probe and to cut down upon its end then a tent is passed into each opening.", "But if we deem the fistula to be double or multiple yet only short and confined to flesh we should not make use of a tent because it treats one part and omits the rest but the same medicaments dry are put into a writing-quill and that having been placed against the orifice of the fistula is to be blown through in order that these

vetch to which also a little honey should be added.", "Thus it generally happens that that covering which is between the opening and the sound flesh is destroyed by the medicaments and comes quite away and underneath is a clean ulceration when this has occurred agglutinants are applied especially a sponge steeped in boiled honey.", "I am not unaware that many favour the insertion of lint formed into a tent and dipped in honey but this agglutinates more quickly than flesh is formed.", "There need be no fear that clean flesh in contact with clean flesh will fail to unite we see that there is
