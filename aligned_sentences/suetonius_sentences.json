subsisted with unrivalled glory during a period of about four hundred and sixty years relapsed into a state of despotism whence it never more could emerge.", "So sudden a transition from prosperity to the ruin of public freedom without the intervention of any foreign enemy excites a reasonable conjecture that the constitution in which it could take place however vigorous in appearance must have lost that soundness of political health which had enabled it to endure through so many ages.", "A short view of its preceding state and of that in which it was at the time of the revolution now mentioned will best ascertain the foundation of such a conjecture.", "Though the Romans upon the expulsion of Tarquin made an essential change in the political form of the state they did not carry their detestation of regal authority so far as to abolish the religious institutions of Numa Pompilius the second of their kings according to which the priesthood with all the influence annexed to that order was placed in the hands of the aristocracy.", "By this wise policy a restraint was put upon the fickleness and violence of the people in matters of government and a decided superiority given to the Senate both in the deliberative and executive parts of administration.", "This advantage was afterwards indeed diminished by the creation of Tribunes of the people a set of men whose ambition often embroiled the Republic in civil dissensions and who at last abused their authority to such a degree that they became instruments of aggrandizement to any leading men in the state who could purchase their friendship.", "In general however the majority of the Tribunes being actuated by views which comprehended the interests of the multitude rather than those of individuals they did not so much endanger the liberty as they interrupted the tranquillity of the public and when the occasional commotions subsided there remained no permanent ground for the establishment of personal usurpation.", "In every government an object of the last importance to the peace and welfare of society is the morals of the people and in proportion as a community is enlarged by propagation or the accession of a multitude of new members a more strict attention is requisite to guard against that dissolution of manners to which a crowded and extensive capital has a natural tendency.", "Of this the Romans became sensible in the growing state of the Republic.", "In the year of the City 312 two magistrates were first created for taking an account of the number of the people and the value of their estates and soon after they were invested with the authority not only of inspecting the morals of individuals but of inflicting public censure for any licentiousness of conduct or violation of decency.", "Thus both the civil and religious institutions concurred to restrain the people within the bounds of good order and obedience to the laws at the same time that the frugal life of the ancient Romans proved a strong security against those vices which operate most effectually towards sapping the foundations of a state.", "But in the time of Julius Casar the barriers of public liberty were become too weak to restrain the audacious efforts of ambitious and desperate men.", "The veneration for the constitution usually a powerful check to treasonable designs had been lately violated by the usurpations of Marius and Sylla.", "The salutary terrors of religion no longer predominated over the consciences of men.", "The shame of public censure was extinguished in general depravity.", "An eminent historian who lived at that time informs us that venality universally prevailed amongst the Romans and a writer who flourished soon after observes that luxury and dissipation had encumbered almost all so much with debt that they beheld with a degree of complacency the prospect of civil war and confusion.", "The extreme degree of profligacy at which the Romans were now arrived is in nothing more evident than that this age gave birth to the most horrible conspiracy which occurs in the annals of human kind viz.", "that of Catiline.", "This was not the project of a few desperate and abandoned individuals but of a number of men of the most illustrious rank in the state and it appears beyond doubt that Julius Caesar was accessory to the design which was no less than to extirpate the Senate divide amongst themselves both the public and private treasures and set Rome on fire.", "The causes which prompted to this tremendous project'it is generally admitted were luxury prodigality irreligion a total corruption of manners and above all as the immediate cause the pressing necessity in which the conspirators were involved by their extreme dissipation.", "The enormous debt in which Caesar himself was early involved countenances an opinion that his anxiety to procure the province of Gaul proceeded chiefly from this cause.", "But during nine years in which he held that province he acquired such riches as must have rendered him without competition the most opulent person in the state.", "If nothing more therefore than a splendid establishment had been the object of his pursuit he had attained to the summit of his wishes.", "But when we find him persevering in a plan of aggrandizement beyond this period of his fortunes we can ascribe his conduct to no other motive than that of outrageous ambition.", "He projected the building of a new Forum at Rome for the ground only of which he was to pay $4ooo000000 he raised legions in Gaul at his own charges he promised such entertamments to the people as had never been known at Rome from the foundation of the city.", "All these circumstances evince some latent design of procuring such a popularity as might give him an uncontrolled influence in the management of public affairs.", "Pompey we are told was wont to to say that Caesar not being able with all his riches to fulfil the promises which he had made wished to throw everything into confusion.", "There may have been some foundation for this remark but the opinion of Cicero is more probable that Caesar's mind was seduced with the temptations of chimerical glory.", "It is observable that neither Cicero nor Pompey intimates any suspicion that Caesar was apprehensive of being impeached for his conduct had he returned to Rome in a private station.", "Yet that there was reason for such an apprehension the positive declaration of L. Domitius leaves little room to doubt especially when we consider the number of enemies that Caesar had in the Senate and the coolness of his former friend Pompey ever after the death of Julia.", "The proposed impeachment was founded upon a notorious charge of prosecuting measures destructive of the interests of the commonwealth and tending ultimately to an object incompatible with public freedom.", "Indeed considering the extreme corruption which prevailed amongst the Romans at this time it is more than probable that Caesar would have been acquitted of the charge but at such an expense as must have stripped him of all his riches and placed him again in a situation ready to attempt a disturbance of the public tranquillity.", "For it is said that he purchased the friendship of Curio at the commencement of the civil war with a bribe little short of half a million sterling.", "Whatever Caesar's private motive may have been for taking arms against his country he embarked in an enterprise of a nature the most dangerous and had Pompey conducted himself in any degree suitable to the reputation which he had formerly acquired the contest would in all probability have terminated in favour of public freedom.", "But by dilatory measures in the beginning by imprudently withdrawing his army from Italy into a distant province and by not pursuing the advantage he had gained by the vigorous repulse of Caesar's troops in their attack upon his camp this commander lost every opportunity of extinguishing a war which was to determine the fate and even the existence of the Republic.", "It was accordingly determined on the plains of Pharsalia where Caesar obtained a victory which was not more decisive than unexpected.", "He was now no longer amenable either to the tribunal of the Senate or the power of the laws but triumphed at once over his enemies and the constitution of his country.", "It is to the honour of Caesar that when he had obtained the supreme power he exercised it with a degree of moderation beyond what was generally expected by those who had fought on the side of the Republic.", "Of his private life either before or after this period little is transmitted in history.", "Henceforth however he seems to have lived chiefly at Rome near which he had a small villa upon an eminence commanding a beautiful prospect.", "His time was almost entirely occupied with public affairs in the management of which though he employed many agents he appears to have had none in the character of actual minister.", "He was in general easy of access but Cicero in a letter to a friend complains of having been treated with the indignity of waiting a considerable time amongst a crowd in an anti-chamber before he could have an audience.", "The elevation of Caesar placed him not above discharging reciprocally the social duties in the intercourse of life.", "He returned the visits of those who waited upon him and would sup at their houses.", "At table and in the use of wine he was habitually temperate.", "Upon the whole he added nothing to his own happiness by all the dangers the fatigues and the perpetual anxiety which he had incurred in the pursuit of unlimited power.", "His health was greatly impaired his former cheerfulness of temper though not his magnanimity appears to have forsaken him and we behold in his fate a memorable example of illustrious talents

a design of recalling him with the view as was supposed of appointing him his successor.", "The father of young Agrippa had been greatly beloved by the Romans and the fate of his mother Julia though

increased not only by a strong suspicion but a general surmise that his elder brothers Caius and Lucius had been violently taken off to make way for the succession of Tiberius.", "That an obstruction was apprehended to Tiberius's succession from this quarter is put beyond all doubt when we find that the death of Augustus was industriously kept secret until young Agrippa should be removed who it is

left by Tacitus undetermined.", "To pave the way for this union he divorced his wife Scribonia and with the approbation of the Augurs which he could have no difficulty in obtaining celebrated his nuptials with Livia.", "There ensued from this marriage no issue though much desired by both parties but Livia retained without interruption an unbounded ascendancy over the emperor whose confidence she abused while the uxorious husband little suspected that he was cherishing in his bosom a viper who was to prove the destruction of his house.", "She appears to have entertained a predominant ambition of giving an heir to the Roman empire and since it could not be done by any fruit of her marriage with Augustus she resolved on accomplishing that end in the person of Tiberius the eldest son by her former husband.", "The plan which she devised for this purpose was to exterminate all the male offspring of Augustus by his daughter Julia who was married to Agrippa a stratagem which when executed.would procure for Tiberius through the means of adoption the eventual succession to the empire.", "The cool yet sanguinary policy and the patient perseverance of resolution with which she prosecuted her design have seldom been equalled.", "While the sons of Julia were yet young and while there was still a possibility that she herself might have issue by Augustus she suspended her project in the hope perhaps that accident or disease might operate in its favour but when the natural term of her constitution had put a period to her hopes of progeny and when the grandsons of the emperor were risen to the years of manhood and had been adopted by him she began to carry into execution what she long had meditated.", "The first object devoted to destruction was C.

thither from Rome or met him in the East where he had obtained some appointment.", "From the hand of this traitor perhaps under the pretext of exercising the authority of a preceptor but in reality instigated by Livia the young prince received a fatal blow of which he died some time after.", "The manner of Caius's death seems to have been carefully kept from the knowledge of Augustus who promoted Lollius to the consulship and made him governor of a province but by his rapacity in this station he afterwards incurred the emperor's displeasure.", "The true character of this person had escaped the keen discernment of Horace as well as the sagacity of the emperor for in two epistles addressed to Lollius he mentions him as great and accomplished in the superlative degree maxime Lolli liberrime Lolli so imposing had been the manners and address of this deceitfnl courtier.", "Lucius the second son of Julia was banished into Campania for using as it is said seditious language against his grandfather.", "In the seventh year of his exile Augustus proposed to recall him but Livia and Tiberius dreading the consequences of his being restored to the emperor's favour put in practice the expedient of having him immediately assassinated.", "Postumus Agrippa the third son incurred the displeasure of his grandfather in the same way as Lucius and was confined at Surrentum where he remained a prisoner until he was put to death by the order either of Livia alone or in conjunction with Tiberius as was before observed.", "Such was the catastrophe through the means of Livia of all the grandsons of Augustus and reason justifies the inference that she who scrupled not to lay violent hands upon those young men had formerly practised every artifice that could operate towards rendering them obnoxious to the emperor.", "We may even ascribe to her dark intrigues the dissolute conduct of Julia for the woman who could secretly act as procuress to her own husband would feel little restraint upon her mind against corrupting his daughter when such an effect might contribute to answer the purpose which she had in view.", "But in the ingratitude of Tiberius however undutiful and reprehensible in a son towards a parent she at last experienced a just retribution for the crimes in which she had trained him to procure the succession to the empire.", "To the disgrace of her sex she introduced amongst the Romans the horrible practice of domestic murder little known before the times when the thirst or intoxication of unlimited power had vitiated the social affections and

endeavoured to secure in his interest every lady of distinguished connections by giving secretly to each of them a promise of marriage as soon as he should arrive at the sovereignty.", "The chief obstacles in his way were the sons and grandsons of Tiberius and these he soon sacrificed to his ambition under various pretences.", "Drusus the eldest of this progeny having in a fit of passion struck the favourite was destined by him to destruction.", "For this purpose he had the presumption to seduce Livia the wife of Drusus to whom she had borne several children and she consented to marry her adulterer upon the death of her husband who was soon after poisoned through the means of an eunuch named Lygdus by order of her and Sejanus.", "Drusus was the son of Tiberius by Vipsania one of

senate as his successor in the empire the mind of Sejanus was more than ever inflamed by the united and now furious passions of love and ambition.", "He therefore urged his demand with increased importunity but the emperor still refusing his consent and things being not yet ripe for an immediate revolt Sejanus thought nothing so favourable for the prosecution of his designs as the absence of Tiberius from the capital.", "With this view under the pretence of relieving his master from the cares of government he persuaded him to retire to a distance from Rome.", "The emperor indolent and luxurious approved of the proposal and retired into Campania leaving to his ambitious minister the whole direction of the empire.", "Had Sejanus now been governed by common prudence and moderation he might have attained to the accomplishment of all his wishes but a natural impetuosity of temper and the intoxication of power precipitated him into measures which soon effected his destruction.", "As if entirely emancipated from the control of a master he publicly declared himself sovereign of the Roman empire and that Tiberius who had by this time retired to Capri was only the dependent prince of that tributary island.", "He even went so far in degrading the emperor as to have him introduced in a ridiculous light upon the stage.", "Advice of Sejanus's proceedings was soon carried to the emperor at Capri his indignation was immediately excited and with a confidence founded upon an authority exercised for several years he sent orders for accusing Sejanus before the senate.", "This mandate no sooner arrived than the audacious minister was deserted by his adherents he was in a short time after seized without resistance and strangled in prison the same day.", "Human nature recoils with horror at the cruelties of this execrable tyrant who having first imbrued his hands in the blood of his own relations proceeded to exercise them upon the public with indiscriminate fury.", "Neither age nor sex afforded any exemption from his insatiable thirst for blood.", "Innocent children were condemned to death and butchered in the presence of their parents virgins without any imputed guilt were sacrificed to a similar destiny but there being an ancient custom of not strangling females in that situation they were first deflowered by the executioner and afterwards strangled as if an atrocious addition to cruelty could sanction the exercise of it.", "Fathers were constrained by violence to witness the death of their own children and even the tears of a mother at the execution of her child were punished as a capital offence.", "Some extraordinary calamities occasioned by accident added to the horrors of the reign.", "A great number of houses on Mount Ccelius were destroyed by fire and by the fall of a temporary building at Fidenae erected for the purpose of exhibiting public shows about twenty thousand persons were either greatly hurt or crushed to death in the ruins.", "By another fire which afterwards broke out a part of the Circus was destroyed with the numerous buildings on Mgunt Aventine.", "The only act of munificence displayed by Tiberius during his reign was upon the occasion of those fires when to qualify the severity of his government he indemnified the most considerable sufferers for the loss they had sustained.", "Through the whole of his life Tiberius seems to have conducted himself with a uniform repugnance to nature.", "Affable on a few occasions but in general averse to society he indulged from his earliest years a moroseness of disposition which counterfeited the appearance of austere virtue and in the decline of life wRien it is common to reform from juvenile indiscretions he launched forth into excesses of a kind the most.unnatural and most detestable.", "Considering the vicious passions which had ever brooded in his heart it may seem surprising that he restrained himself within the bounds of decency during so many years after his accession but though utterly destitute of reverence or affection for his mother he still felt during her life a filial awe upon his mind and after her death ie was actuated by a slavish fear of Sejanus until at last political necessity absolved him likewise from this restraint.", "These checks being both removed he rioted without any control either from sentiment or authority.", "Pliny relates that the art of making glass malleable was actually discovered under the reign of Tiberius and that the shop and tools of the artist were destroyed lest by the establishment of this invention gold and silver should lose their value.", "Dion adds that the author of the discovery was put to death.", "The gloom which darkened the Roman capital during this melancholy period shed a baleful influence on the progress of science throughout the empire and literature languished during the present reign in the same proportion as ithad flourished in the preceding.", "It is doubtful' whether such a change might not have happened in some degree even had the government of Tiberius been equally mild with that of his predecessor.", "The prodigious fame of the writers of the Augustan age by repressing emulation tended to a general diminution of the efforts of genius for some time while the banishment of Ovid it is probable and the capital punishment of a subsequent poet for censuring the character of Agamemnon operated towards the farther discouragement of poetical exertions.", "There now existed no circumstance to counterbalance these disadvantages.", "Genius no longer found a patron either in the emperor or his minister and the gates of the palace were shut against all who cultivated the elegant pursuits of the Muses.", "Panders catamites assassins wretches stained with every crime were the constant attendants as the only fit companions of the tyrant who now occupied the throne.", "We are informed however that even this emperor had a taste for the liberal arts and that he composed a lyric poem upon the death of Lucius Caesar with some Greek poems in imitation of Euphorion Rhianus and Parthenius.", "But none of these

particularly remarked on this occasion that all the Caesars who had the praenomen of Caius died by the sword from the Caius Caesar who was slain in the times of Cinna.", "Remarks on Caligula Unfortunately a great chasm in the annals of Tacitus at this period precludes all information from that historian respecting the reign of Caligula but from what he mentions towards the close of the preceding chapter it is evident that Caligula was forward to seize the reins of government upon the death of Tiberius whom though he rivalled him in his vices he was far from imitating in his dissimulation.", "Amongst the people the remembrance of Germanicus' virtues cherished for his family an attachment which was probably increased by its misfortunes and they were anxious to see revived in the son the popularity of the father.", "Considering however that Caligula's vicious disposition was already known and that it had even been an inducement with Tiberius to procure his succession in order that it might prove a foil to his own memory it is surprising that no effort was made at this juncture to shake off the despotism which had been so intolerable in the last reign and restore the ancient liberty of the republic.", "Since the commencement of the imperial dominion there never had been any period so favourable for a counter-revolution as the present crisis.", "There existed now no Livia to influence the minds of the senate and people in respect of the government nor was there any other person allied to the family of Germanicus whose countenance or intrigues could promote the views of Caligula.", "He himself was now only in the twenty-fifth year of his age was totally inexperienced in the administration of public affairs had never performed even the smallest service to his country and was generally known to be of a character which disgraced his illustrious descent.", "Yet in spite of all these circumstances such was the destiny of Rome that his accession afforded joy to the soldiers who had known him in his childhood and to the populace in the capital as well as the people in the provinces who were flattered with the delusive expectation of receiving a prince who should adorn the throne with the amiable virtues of Germanicus.", "It is difficult to say whether weakness of understanding or corruption of morals were more conspicuous in the character of Caligula.", "He seems to have discovered from his earliest years an innate depravity of mind which was undoubtedly much increased by defect of education.", "He had lost both his parents at an early period of life and from Tiberius's own character as well as his views in training the person who should succeed him on the throne there is reason to think that if any attention whatever was paid to the education of Caligula it was directed to vitiate all his faculties and passions rather than to correct and improve them.", "If such was really the object it was indeed prosecuted with success.", "The commencement however of his reign was such as by no means prognosticated its subsequent transition.", "The sudden change of his conduct the astonishing mixture of imbecility and presumption of moral turpitude and frantic extravagance which he afterwards evinced such as rolling himself over heaps of gold his treatment of his horse Incitatus and his design of making him consul seem to justify a suspicion that his brain had actually been affected either by the potion said to have been given him by his wife Caesonia or otherwise.", "Philtres orlopyejotions as they were called were frequent in those times and the people believed that they operated upon the mind by a mysterious and sympathetic power.", "It is however beyond a doubt that their effects were produced entirely by the action of their physical the satyrion which according to Pliny was a provocative.", "They were generally given by women to their husbands at bed-time and it was necessary towards their successful operation that the parties should sleep together.", "This circumstance explains the whole mystery.", "The philtres were nothing more than medicines of a stimulating quality which after exciting violent but temporary effects enfeebled the constitution and occaioned nervous disorders by which the mental faculties as well as the corporeal might be injured.", "That this was really the case with Caligula seems probable not only from the falling sickness to which he was subject but from the habitual wakefulness of which he complained.", "The profusion of this emperor during his short reign of three years and ten months is unexampled in history.", "In the midst of profound peace without any extraordinary charges either civil or military he expended in less than one year besides the current revenue of the empire the sum of $108796875 which had been left by Tiberius at his death.", "To supply the extravagance of future years new and exorbitant taxes were imposed upon the people and those too on the necessaries of life.", "There existed now among the Romans every motive that could excite a general indignation against the government yet such was still the dread of imperial power though vested in the hands of so weak and despicable a sovereign that no insurrection was attempted nor any extensive conspiracy formed but the obnoxious emperor fell at last a sacrifice to a few centurions of his own guard.", "This reign was of too short duration to afford any new productions in literature but had it been extended to a much longer period the effects would probably have been the same.", "Polite learning never could flourish under an emperor who entertained a design of destroying the writings of Virgil and Livy.", "It is fortunate that these and other valuable productions of antiquity were too widely diffused over the world and too carefully preserved to be in danger of perishing through the frenzy of this capricious barbarian."]]], [[" Patrem Claudi Caesaris Drusum olim Decimum

The soldiers having arrogated to themselves the right of nomination they either unanimously elected one and the same person or different parties supporting the interests of their respective favourites there arose between them a contention which was usually determined by an appeal to arms and followed by the assassination of the unsuccessful competitor.. Vitellius by being a parasite of all the empelors from Tiberius to Nero inclusively had arisen to a high military rank by which with a spirit of enterprise and large promises to the soldiery it was not difficult to snatch the reins of government while they were yet fluctuating in the hands of Otho..
