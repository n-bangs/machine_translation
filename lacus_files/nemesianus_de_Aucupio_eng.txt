It is far the silliest of birds for although it has perched and was watched the snare laid for it, yet reckless of self it darts upon its own hurt. You, however, on finding the circles of the noose drawn tight, must hasten up and carry off your prey with its whirring wings. For it is quick to shake off the treacherous bonds of the neck when caught, deriding with hoarse cry the hunter s design and now in freedom delighting in the joy of peace.
