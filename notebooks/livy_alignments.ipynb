Antenor, with a company of Eneti who had been expelled from Paphlagonia in a revolution and were looking for a home and a leader &mdash;for they had lost their king, Pylaemenes, at Troy<note>See the <hi rend=\"italics\">Iliad,</hi> v. 576.</note> &mdash;came to the inmost bay of the Adriatic.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> There, driving out the Euganei, who dwelt between the sea and the Alps, the Eneti and Trojans took possession of those lands. And in fact the place where they first landed is called Troy, and the district is therefore known as Trojan, while the people as a whole are called the Veneti.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> Aeneas, driven from home by a similar misfortune, but guided by fate to undertakings of greater consequence, came first to Macedonia; thence was carried, in his quest of a place of settlement, to Sicily; and from Sicily laid his course towards the land of Laurentum. This place too is called Troy.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> Landing there, the Trojans, as men who, after their all but immeasurable wanderings, had nothing left but their swords and ships, were driving booty from the fields, when King Latinus and the Aborigines, who then occupied that country, rushed down from their city and their fields to repel with arms the violence of the invaders. From this point the tradition follows two <pb id=\"p.11\"/>lines. Some say that Latinus, having been defeated in the battle, made a peace with Aeneas, and later an alliance of marriage.<note>This, in a nutshell, is the form of the legend on which Virgil based Books vii.-xii. of the <hi rend=\"italics\">Aeneid.</hi></note>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> Others maintain that when the opposing lines had been drawn up, Latinus did not wait for the charge to sound, but advanced amidst his chieftains and summoned the captain of the strangers to a parley.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/> He then inquired what men they were, whence they had come, what mishap had caused them to leave their home, and what they sought in landing on the coast of Laurentum.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"8\"/> He was told that the people were Trojans and their leader Aeneas, son of Anchises and Venus; that their city had been burnt, and that, driven from home, they were looking for a dwelling-place and a site where they might build a city. Filled with wonder at the renown of the race and the hero, and at his spirit, prepared alike for war or peace, he gave him his right hand in solemn pledge of lasting friendship.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"9\"/> The commanders then made a treaty, and the armies saluted each other. Aeneas became a guest in the house of Latinus; there the latter, in the presence of his household gods, added a domestic treaty to the public one, by giving his daughter in marriage to Aeneas.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"10\"/> This event removed any doubt in the minds of the Trojans that they had brought their wanderings to an end at last in a permanent and settled habitation.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"11\"/> They founded a town, which Aeneas named Lavinium, after his wife. In a short time, moreover, there was a male scion of the new marriage, to whom his parents gave the name of Ascanius.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t',\n",
       " '\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>War was then made upon Trojans and Aborigines alike. Turnus was king of the Rutulians, and to him Lavinia had been betrothed before the coming <pb id=\"p.13\"/>of Aeneas. Indignant that a stranger should be preferred before him, he attacked, at the same time, both Aeneas and Latinus.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> Neither army came off rejoicing from that battle. The Rutulians were beaten: the victorious Aborigines and Trojans lost their leader Latinus.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> Then Turnus and the Rutulians, discouraged at their situation, fled for succour to the opulent and powerful Etruscans and their king Mezentius, who held sway in Caere, at that time an important town. Mezentius had been, from the very beginning, far from pleased at the birth of the new city; he now felt that the Trojan state was growing much more rapidly than was altogether safe for its neighbours, and readily united his forces with those of the Rutulians.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> Aeneas, that he might win the goodwill of the Aborigines to confront so formidable an array, and that all might possess not only the same rights but also the same name, called both nations Latins;<note>Virgil makes Jupiter grant, as a favour to Juno, that the Trojan name shall be sunk in the Latin (<hi rend=\"italics\">Aen.</hi> xii. 835).</note> and from that time on the Aborigines were no less ready and faithful than the Trojans in the service of King Aeneas.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> Accordingly, trusting to this friendly spirit of the two peoples, which were growing each day more united, and, despite the power of Etruria, which had filled with the glory of her name not only the lands but the sea as well, along the whole extent of Italy from the Alps to the Sicilian Strait, Aeneas declined to defend himself behind his walls, as he might have done, but led out his troops to battle.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> The fight which ensued was a victory for the Latins: for Aeneas it was, besides, the last of his mortal labours. He lies buried, whether it is fitting and right <pb id=\"p.15\"/>to term him god or man, on the banks of the river Numicus; men, however, call him Jupiter Indiges.<note><hi rend=\"italics\">Indiges</hi> means <quote>of or belonging to a certain place</quote> (Fowler, <hi rend=\"italics\">Fest.</hi> p. 192). Dion. Hal. i. 64, says that the Latins made a shrine to Aeneas with an inscription in which he was called <foreign lang=\"greek\">path\\\\r xqo/nios</foreign>(<hi rend=\"italics\">Pater Indiges</hi>). He was also called <hi rend=\"italics\">Deus Indiges</hi> and <hi rend=\"italics\">Aeneas Indiges.</hi></note>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t',\n",
       " '\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>Ascanius, Aeneas\\' son, was not yet ripe for authority; yet the authority was kept for him, unimpaired, until he arrived at manhood. Meanwhile, under a woman\\'s regency, the Latin State and the kingdom of his father and his grandfather stood unshaken &mdash;so strong was Lavinia\\'s character &mdash;until the boy could claim it.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> I shall not discuss the question &mdash;for who could affirm for certain so ancient a matter? &mdash;whether this boy was Ascanius, or an elder brother, born by Creusa while Ilium yet stood, who accompanied his father when he fled from the city, being the same whom the Julian family call lulus and claim as the author of their name.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> This Ascanius, no matter where born, or of what mother &mdash;it is agreed in any case that he was Aeneas\\' son &mdash;left Lavinium, when its population came to be too large, for it was already a flourishing and wealthy city for those days, to his mother, or stepmother, and founded a new city himself below the Alban Mount.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> This was known from its position, as it lay stretched out along the ridge, by the name of Alba Longa. From the settlement of Lavinium to the planting of the colony at Alba Longa was an interval of some thirty years.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> Yet the nation had grown so powerful, in consequence especially of the defeat of the Etruscans, that even when Aeneas died, and even when a woman became its regent and a boy began his apprenticeship as king, neither Mezentius and his Etruscans nor any other neighbours dared to attack them.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> Peace had been agreed to on these terms, that the River Albula, which men now call the Tiber, should be the boundary <pb id=\"p.17\"/>between the Etruscans and the Latins.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/> Next Silvius reigned, son of Ascanius, born, as it chanced, in the forest. He begat Aeneas Silvius, and he Latinus Silvius. By him several colonies were planted, and called the Ancient Latins.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"8\"/> Thereafter the cognomen Silvius was retained by all who ruled at Alba. From Latinus came Alba, from Alba Atys, from Atys Capys, from Capys Capetus, from Capetus Tiberinus.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"9\"/> This last king was drowned in crossing the River Albula, and gave the stream the name which has been current with later generations. Then Agrippa, son of Tiberinus, reigned, and after Agrippa Romulus Silvius was king, having received the power from his father. Upon the death of Romulus by lightning, the kingship passed from him to Aventinus. This king was buried on that hill, which is now a part of the City of Rome, and gave his name to the hill.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"10\"/> Proca ruled next. He begat Numitor and Amulius; to Numitor, the elder, he bequeathed the ancient realm of the Silvian family. Yet violence proved more potent than a father\\'s wishes or respect for seniority. Amulius drove out his brother and ruled in his stead.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"11\"/> Adding crime to crime, he destroyed Numitor\\'s male issue; and Rhea Silvia, his brother\\'s daughter, he appointed a Vestal under pretence of honouring, her, and by consigning her to perpetual virginity, deprived her of the hope of children.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t',\n",
       " '\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>But the Fates were resolved, as I suppose, upon the founding of this great City, and the beginning of the mightiest of empires, next after that of Heaven.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> The Vestal was ravished, and having given birth to twin sons, named Mars as the father of her doubtful offspring, whether actually so believing, or because it seemed less wrong if a god <pb id=\"p.19\"/>were the author of her fault.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> But neither gods nor men protected the mother herself or her babes from the king\\'s cruelty; the priestess he ordered to be manacled and cast into prison, the children to be committed to the river.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> It happened by singular good fortune that the Tiber having spread beyond its banks into stagnant pools afforded nowhere any access to the regular channel of the river, and the men who brought the twins were led to hope that being infants they might be drowned, no matter how sluggish the stream.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> So they made shift to discharge the king\\'s command, by exposing the babes at the nearest point of the overflow, where the fig-tree Ruminalis &mdash;formerly, they say, called Romularis &mdash;now stands.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> In those days this was a wild and uninhabited region. The story persists that when the floating basket in which the children had been exposed was left high and dry by the receding water, a she-wolf, coming down out of the surrounding hills to slake her thirst, turned her steps towards the cry of the infants, and with her teats gave them suck so gently, that the keeper of the royal flock found her licking them with her tongue.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/> Tradition assigns to this man the name of Faustulus, and adds that he carried the twins to his hut and gave them to his wife Larentia to rear. Some think that Larentia, having been free with her favours, had got the name of <quote>she-wolf</quote> among the shepherds, and that this gave rise to this marvellous story.<note>The word <hi rend=\"italics\">lupa</hi> was sometimes used in the sense of <quote>courtesan.</quote></note>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"8\"/> The boys, thus born and reared, had no sooner attained to youth than they began &mdash;yet without neglecting the farmstead or the flocks &mdash;to range the glades of the mountains for game.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"9\"/> Having in this way gained both strength and resolution, they would now not <pb id=\"p.21\"/>only face wild beasts, but would attack robbers laden with their spoils, and divide up what they took from them among the shepherds, with whom they shared their toils and pranks, while their band of young men grew larger every day.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t',\n",
       " '\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>They say that the Palatine was even then the scene of the merry festival of the Lupercalia which we have to-day, and that the hill was named Pallantium, from Pallanteum, an Arcadian city, and then Palatium.<note>The derivation here given is fanciful. The word is probably akin to <hi rend=\"italics\">palus,</hi> <quote>pale,</quote> and meant a <quote>fenced place.</quote></note>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> There Evander, an Arcadian of that stock, who had held the place many ages before the time of which I am writing, is said to have established the yearly rite, derived from Arcadia, that youths should run naked about in playful sport, doing honour to Lycaean Pan, whom the Romans afterwards called Inuus.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> When the young men were occupied in this celebration, the rite being generally known, some robbers who had been angered by the loss of their plunder laid an ambush for them, and although Romulus successfully defended himself, captured Remus and delivered up their prisoner to King Amulius, even lodging a complaint against him.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> The main charge was that the brothers made raids on the lands of Numitor, and pillaged them, with a band of young fellows which they had got together, like an invading enemy.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> So Remus was given up to Numitor to be punished. From the very beginning Faustulus had entertained the suspicion that they were children of the royal blood that he was bringing up in his house; for he was aware both that infants had been exposed by order of the king, and that the time when he had himself taken up the children exactly coincided with that event. But he had been unwilling that the <pb id=\"p.23\"/>matter should be disclosed prematurely, until opportunity offered or necessity compelled.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> Necessity came first; accordingly, driven by fear, he revealed the facts to Romulus. It chanced that Numitor too, having Remus in custody, and hearing that the brothers were twins, had been reminded, upon considering their age and their far from servile nature, of his grandsons. The inquiries he made led him to the same conclusion, so that he was almost ready to acknowledge Remus. Thus on every hand the toils were woven about the king.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/> Romulus did not assemble his company of youths &mdash;for he was not equal to open violence &mdash;but commanded his shepherds to come to the palace at an appointed time, some by one way, some by another, and so made his attack upon the king; while from the house of Numitor came Remus, with another party which he had got together, to help his brother. So Romulus slew the king. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t',\n",
       " '\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>At the beginning of the fray Numitor exclaimed that an enemy had invaded the city and attacked the palace, and drew off the active men of the place to serve as an armed garrison for the defence of the citadel; and when he saw the young men approaching, after they had dispatched the king, to congratulate him, he at once summoned a council, and laid before it his brother\\'s crimes against himself, the parentage of his grandsons, and how they had been born, reared, and recognised.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> He then announced the tyrant\\'s death, and declared himself to be responsible for it. The brothers advanced with their band through the midst of the crowd, and hailed their grandfather king, whereupon such a shout of assent arose from the entire throng as confirmed the new monarch\\'s title and authority.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/><pb id=\"p.25\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>The Alban state being thus made over to Numitor, Romulus and Remus were seized with the desire to found a city in the region where they had been exposed and brought up. And in fact the population of Albans and Latins was too large; besides, there were the shepherds. All together, their numbers might easily lead men to hope that Alba would be small, and Lavinium small, compared with the city which they should build.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> These considerations were interrupted by the curse of their grandsires, the greed of kingly power, and by a shameful quarrel which grew out of it, upon an occasion innocent enough. Since the brothers were twins, and respect for their age could not determine between them, it was agreed that the gods who had those places in their protection should choose by augury who should give the new city its name, who should govern it when built. Romulus took the Palatine for his augural quarter, Remus the Aventine. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t',\n",
       " '\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>Remus<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 753</note> is said to have been the first to receive an augury, from the flight of six vultures. The omen had been already reported when twice that number appeared to Romulus. Thereupon each was saluted king by his own followers, the one party laying claim to the honour from priority, the other from the number of the birds.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> They then engaged in a battle of words and, angry taunts leading to bloodshed, Remus was struck down in the affray. The commoner story is that Remus leaped over the new walls in mockery of his brother, whereupon Romulus in great anger slew him, and in menacing wise added these words withal, <quote><hi rend=\"italics\">So</hi> perish whoever else shall leap over my walls!</quote><note>A form of the legend preserved by Dion. Hal. i. 87, and Ovid, <hi rend=\"italics\">Fasti,</hi> iv. 843, names Celer, whom Romulus had put in charge of the rising wall, as the slayer of Remus.</note>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> Thus Romulus acquired sole power, and the city, thus founded, was called by its founder\\'s name.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> <pb id=\"p.27\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>His first act was to fortify the Palatine, on which<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 753</note> he had himself been reared. To other gods he sacrificed after the Alban custom, but employed the Greek for Hercules, according to the institution of Evander.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> The story is as follows: Hercules, after slaying Geryones, was driving off his wondrously beautiful cattle, when, close to the river Tiber, where he had swum across it with the herd before him, he found a green spot, where he could let the cattle rest and refresh themselves with the abundant grass; and being tired from his journey he lay down himself.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> When he had there fallen into a deep sleep, for he was heavy with food and wine, a shepherd by the name of Cacus, who dwelt hard by and was insolent by reason of his strength, was struck with the beauty of the animals, and wished to drive them off as plunder. But if he had driven the herd into his cave, their tracks would have been enough to guide their owner to the place in his search; he therefore chose out those of the cattle that were most remarkable for their beauty, and turning them the other way, dragged them into the cave by their tails.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> At daybreak Hercules awoke. Glancing over the herd, and perceiving that a part of their number was lacking, he proceeded to the nearest cave, in case there might be foot-prints leading into it. When he saw that they were all turned outward and yet did not lead to any other place, he was confused and bewildered, and made ready to drive his herd away from that uncanny spot.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/> As the cattle were being driven off, some of them lowed, as usually happens, missing those which had been left behind. They were answered with a low by the cattle shut up in the cave, and this made Hercules turn back. When he came towards the <pb id=\"p.29\"/>cave, Cacus would have prevented his approach with<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 753</note> force, but received a blow from the hero\\'s club, and calling in vain upon the shepherds to protect him, gave up the ghost.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"8\"/> Evander, an exile from the Peloponnese, controlled that region in those days, more through personal influence than sovereign power. He was a man revered for his wonderful invention of letters,<note>Evander is said to have invented the Roman alphabet.</note> a new thing to men unacquainted with the arts, and even more revered because of the divinity which men attributed to his mother Carmenta, whom those tribes had admired as a prophetess before the Sibyl\\'s coming into Italy.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"9\"/> Now this Evander was then attracted by the concourse of shepherds, who, crowding excitedly about the stranger, were accusing him as a murderer caught red-handed. When he had been told about the deed and the reason for it, and had marked the bearing of the man and his figure, which was somewhat ampler and more august than a mortal\\'s, he inquired who lie was.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"10\"/> Upon learning his name, his father, and his birth-place, he exclaimed, <quote>Hail, Hercules, son of Jupiter! You are he, of whom my mother, truthful interpreter of Heaven, foretold to me that you should be added to the number of the gods, and that an altar should be dedicated to you here which the nation one day to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"11\"/> be the most powerful on earth should call the Greatest Altar, and should serve according to your rite.</quote>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"12\"/> Hercules gave him his hand, and declared that he accepted the omen, and would fulfil the prophecy by establishing and dedicating an altar.

In fact men spurned, at the same time that they feared, both for themselves and their descendants, that great power which was then growing up in their midst; and the envoys were frequently asked, on being dismissed, if they had opened a sanctuary for women as well as for men, for in that way only would they obtain suitable wives.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> This was a bitter insult to the young Romans, and the matter seemed certain to end in violence. Expressly to afford a fitting time and place for this, Romulus, concealing his resentment, made ready solemn games in honour of the equestrian Neptune, which he called Consualia.<note>The Consualia was a harvest festival, held on August 21.

But Romulus himself went amongst them and explained that the pride of their parents had caused this deed, when they had refused their neighbours the right to intermarry; nevertheless the daughters should be wedded and become co-partners in all the possessions of the Romans, in their citizenship and, dearest privilege of all to the human race, in their children; <pb id=\"p.39\"/>only let them moderate their anger, and give their<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 753-717</note> hearts to those to whom fortune had given their persons.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"15\"/> A sense of injury had often given place to affection, and they would find their husbands the kinder for this reason, that every man would earnestly endeavour not only to be a good husband, but also to console his wife for the home and parents she had lost.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"16\"/> His arguments were seconded by the wooing of the men, who excused their act on the score of passion and love, the most moving of all pleas to a woman\\'s heart.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t',\n",

And so the hundred senators shared the power among themselves, establishing ten decuries and appointing one man for each decury to preside over the administration.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> Ten men exercised authority; only one had its insignia and lictors. Five days was the period of his power, which passed in rotation to all; and for a year the monarchy lapsed. This interval was called, as it was, an interregnum, a name which even yet obtains.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/> Murmurs then arose among the plebs that their servitude had been multiplied; that a hundred masters had been given them instead of <pb id=\"p.63\"/>one.

Being summoned to Rome he commanded that, just as Romulus had obeyed the augural omens in building his city and assuming regal power, so too in his own case the gods should be consulted. Accordingly an augur (who thereafter, as a mark of honour, was made a priest of the state in permanent charge of that function) conducted him to the citadel and caused him to sit down on a stone, facing the south.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/> The augur seated himself on Numa\\'s left, having his head covered, and holding his in right hand the crooked staff without a knot <pb id=\"p.67\"/>which they call a <hi rend=\"italics\">lituus.</hi>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"8\"/> Then, looking out over the<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 716</note> City and the country beyond, he prayed to the gods, and marked off the heavens by a line from east to west, designating as \\' right\\' the regions to the south, as \\'left\\' those to the north, and fixing in his mind a landmark opposite to him and as far away as the eye could reach;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"9\"/> next shifting the crook to his left hand and, laying his right hand on Numa\\'s head, he uttered the following prayer: <quote>Father Jupiter, if it is Heaven\\'s will that this man Numa Pompilius, whose head I am touching, be king in Rome, do thou exhibit to us unmistakable signs within those limits which I have set.</quote>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"10\"/> He then specified the auspices which he desired should be sent, and upon their appearance Numa was declared king, and so descended from the augural station.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t',\n",

And fearing lest relief from anxiety on the score of foreign perils might lead men who had hitherto been held back by fear of their enemies and by military discipline into extravagance and idleness, he thought the very first thing to do, as being the most efficacious with a populace which was ignorant and, in those early days, uncivilized, was to imbue them with the fear of Heaven.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> As he could not instil this into their hearts without inventing some marvellous story, he pretended to have nocturnal meetings with the goddess Egeria, and that hers was the advice which guided him in the establishment of rites most approved by the gods, and in the appointment of special priests for the service of each.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p><milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/>And first of all he divided the year into twelve months, according to the revolutions of the moon.

To him he added two other flamens, one for Mars, the other for Quirinus.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> In like manner he designated virgins for Vesta\\'s service &mdash;a priesthood, this, that derived from Alba and so was not unsuited to the founder\\'s stock. That they might be perpetual priestesses of the temple, he assigned them a stipend from the public treasury, and by the rule of virginity and other observances invested them with awe and sanctity.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> He likewise chose twelve Salii for Mars Gradivus, and granted them the distinction of wearing the embroidered tunic and over it a bronze breastplate, and of bearing the divine shields which men call <hi rend=\"italics\">ancilia,</hi><note>The original <hi rend=\"italics\">ancile</hi> was a shield fabled to have fallen from heaven.

With the purpose of eliciting this knowledge from the minds of the gods, Numa dedicated an altar on the Aventine to Jupiter Elicius, and consulted the god by augury, that he might learn what portents were to be regarded.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t',\n",

Not only had they something to occupy their minds, but their constant preoccupation with the gods, now that it seemed to them that concern for human affairs was felt by the heavenly powers, had so tinged the hearts of all with piety, that the nation was governed by its regard for promises and oaths, rather than by the dread of laws and penalties.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> And while Numa\\'s subjects were spontaneously imitating the character of their king, as their unique exemplar, the neighboring peoples also, who had hitherto considered that it was no city but a camp that had been set up in their midst, as a menace to the general peace, came to feel such reverence for them, that they thought it sacrilege to injure a nation so wholly bent upon the worship of the gods.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> There was a grove watered by a perennial spring which flowed through the midst of it, out of a dark cave. Thither <pb id=\"p.75\"/>Numa would often withdraw, without witnesses, as<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 715-672</note> if to meet the goddess; so he dedicated the grove to the Camenae, alleging that they held counsel there with his wife Egeria.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> He also established an annual worship of Faith, to whose chapel he ordered that the flamens should proceed in a two-horse hooded carriage, and should wrap up their arms as far as the fingers before sacrificing, as a sign that faith must be kept, and that even in men\\'s clasped hands her seat is sacred.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> He established many other rites, as well as places of sacrifice, which the pontiffs called <hi rend=\"italics\">Argei.</hi><note>There were six of these shrines or chapels in each of the four regions of the Servian city.

The Alban representatives proceeded rather laxly.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> Received by Tullus with gracious and kindly hospitality, they attended in a friendly spirit the banquet which he gave in their honour. Meanwhile the Romans had been beforehand with them in seeking redress, and, being denied it by the Alban leader, had made a declaration of war, to take effect in thirty days.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> Returning, they reported these things to Tullus, who thereupon invited the Alban envoys to inform him of the object of their mission. They, knowing nothing of what had happened, at first spent some time in apologies. They said they should be sorry to utter anything which might give offence to Tullus, but that they were compelled to do so by their orders; they had come to seek restitution; if it should be denied them they were commanded to declare war.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/> To this Tullus replied: <quote>Tell your king the Roman king calls the gods to witness which people first spurned the other\\'s demand for redress and dismissed its envoys, that they may call down upon the guilty nation all the disasters of this war.</quote>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t',\n",

Meantime Tullus, emboldened principally by the death of the king, and asserting that Heaven\\'s great powers would take vengeance upon all of the Alban name, beginning with their king himself, for their unscrupulous war, made a night march past the enemy\\'s camp and led his army into the country of the Albans. This move drew Mettius out from his fortifications.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> Leading his troops the shortest way towards the enemy, he sent an envoy on ahead to say to Tullus that before they fought it was well that they should confer together; if Tullus would meet him he was confident he had that to say which would be of no less moment to the Roman state than to the Alban. Without rejecting this suggestion, Tullus nevertheless drew up his men in line of battle, in case the proposals should prove impracticable.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> On the other side the Albans also formed up.

Still, the majority, I find, call the Roman brothers Horatii, and theirs is the opinion I incline to adopt.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> To these young men the kings proposed a combat in which each should fight for his own city, the dominion to belong with that side where the victory should rest.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> No objection was raised, and time and place were agreed on. Before proceeding with the battle, a treaty was made between the Romans and the Albans, providing that the nation whose citizens should triumph in this contest should hold undisputed sway over the other nation. One treaty differs from another in its terms, but the same procedure is always employed.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> On the present occasion we are told that they did as follows, nor has tradition preserved the memory of any more ancient compact. The fetial<note>The <hi rend=\"italics\">fetiales</hi> (related to <hi rend=\"italics\">facio,</hi> <quote>do</quote>) were a college of priests whose duties were to represent the state in declaring war, making peace, entering into treaties, etc. <hi rend=\"italics\">The pater</hi> <hi rend=\"italics\">patratus</hi> (from <hi rend=\"italics\">patro,</hi> <quote>accomplish</quote> or <quote>bring about</quote>) was the spokesman of the deputation.</note> asked King Tullus, <quote>Dost thou command me, King, to make a treaty with the <hi rend=\"italics\">pater patratus</hi> of the Alban People?</quote> Being so commanded by the king, he said, <quote>I demand of thee, King, the sacred herb.</quote>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> The king replied, <quote>Thou shalt take it untainted.</quote> The fetial brought from the citadel an untainted plant. After this he asked the king, <quote>Dost thou grant me, King, with my emblems and my companions, the royal sanction, to <pb id=\"p.85\"/>speak for the Roman People of the Quirites?</quote>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> The<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 672-640</note> king made answer, <quote>So far as may be without prejudice to myself and the Roman People of the Quirites, I grant it.</quote> The fetial was Marcus Valerius; he made Spurius Fusius <hi rend=\"italics\">pater patratus,</hi> touching his head and hair with the sacred sprig. The <hi rend=\"italics\">pater patratus</hi> is appointed to pronounce the oath, that is, to solemnize the pact; and this he accomplishes with many words, expressed in a long metrical formula which it is not worth while to quote.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/> The conditions being then recited, he cries, <quote>Hear, Jupiter; hear, <hi rend=\"italics\">pater patratus</hi> of the Alban People: hear ye, People of Alba: From these terms, as they have been publicly rehearsed from beginning to end, without fraud, from these tablets, or this wax, and as they have been this day clearly understood, the Roman People will not be the first to depart.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"8\"/> If it shall first depart from them, by general consent, with malice aforethought, then on that day do thou, great Diespiter, so smite the Roman People as I shall here to-day smite this pig: and so much the harder smite them as thy power and thy strength are greater.</quote>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"9\"/> When Spurius had said these words, he struck the pig with a flint. In like manner the Albans pronounced their own forms and their own oath, by the mouth of their own dictator and priests.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t',\n",
       " '\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>When the treaty had been established, the brothers armed themselves, in accordance with the agreement. On either side the soldiers urged on their champions. They reminded them that their fathers\\' gods, their native land, their parents, and all their countrymen, whether at home or with the army, had their eye only on their swords and their right hands.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> Eager for the combat, as well owing to their <pb id=\"p.87\"/>native spirit as to the shouts of encouragement which<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 672-640</note> filled their ears, the brothers advanced into the space between the two lines of battle. The two armies were drawn up, each in front of its own camp, no longer in any immediate danger, but their concern as great as ever; and no wonder, since empire was staked on those few men\\'s valour and good fortune!\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> Alert, therefore, and in suspense, they concentrated their attention upon this unpleasing spectacle. The signal was given, and with drawn steel, like advancing battle-lines, the six young men rushed to the charge, breathing the courage of great armies. Neither side thought of its own danger, but of the nation\\'s sovereignty or servitude, and how from that day forward their country must experience the fortune they should themselves create.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> The instant they encountered, there was a clash of shields and a flash of glittering blades, while a deep shudder ran through the onlookers, who, as long as neither side had the advantage, remained powerless to speak or breathe.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> Then, in the hand-to-hand fight which followed, wherein were soon exhibited to men\\'s eyes not only struggling bodies and the play of the sword and shield, but also bloody wounds, two of the Romans fell, fatally wounded, one upon the other, while all three of the Albans were wounded.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> At the fall of the Romans a shout of joy burst from the Alban army, while the Roman levies now bade farewell to all their hopes; but not to their anxiety, for they were horror-stricken at the plight of the single warrior whom the three Curiatii had surrounded.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/> He happened to have got no hurt, and though no match for his enemies together, was ready to fight them one at a time. So, to divide their attack, he <pb id=\"p.89\"/>fled, thinking that each of them would pursue him<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 672-640</note> with what speed his wounds permitted.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"8\"/> He had already run some little distance from the spot where they had fought, when, looking back, he saw that they were following at wide intervals and that one of them had nearly overtaken him.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"9\"/> Facing about, he ran swiftly up to his man, and while the Alban host were calling out to the Curiatii to help their brother, Horatius had already slain him, and was hastening, flushed with victory, to meet his second antagonist. Then with a cheer, such as is often drawn from partisans by a sudden turn in a contest, the Romans encouraged their champion, and he pressed on to end the battle.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"10\"/> And so, before the third Curiatius could come up &mdash;and he was not far off &mdash;Horatius dispatched the second.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"11\"/> They were now on even terns, one soldier surviving on each side, but in hope and vigour they were far from equal. The one, unscathed and elated by his double victory, was eager for a third encounter. The other dragged himself along, faint from his wound and exhausted with running; he thought how his brothers had been slaughtered before him, and was a beaten man when he faced his triumphant foe. What followed was no combat.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"12\"/> The Roman cried exultantly, <quote>Two victims I have given to the shades of my brothers: the third I will offer up to the cause of this war, that Roman may rule Alban.</quote> His adversary could barely hold up his shield.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"13\"/> With a downward thrust Horatius buried his sword in the Alban\\'s throat, and despoiled him where he lay. The Romans welcomed their hero with jubilations and thanksgivings, and their joy was all the greater that they had come near despairing. The burial of their dead then claimed the attention <pb id=\"p.91\"/>of the two armies, &mdash;with widely different feelings,<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 672-640</note> since one nation was exalted with imperial power, the other made subject to a foreign sway.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"14\"/> The graves may still be seen where each soldier fell: two Roman graves in one spot, nearer Alba; those of the three Albans towards Rome, but separated, just as they had fought.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t',\n",
       " '\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>Before they left the field Mettius asked, in pursuance of the compact, what Tullus commanded him to do, and the Roman ordered him to hold his young men under arms, saying that he should employ their services, if war broke out with the Veientes.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> The armies then marched home. In the van of the Romans came Horatius, displaying his triple spoils. As he drew near the Porta Capena he was met by his unwedded sister, who had been promised in marriage to one of the Curiatii. When she recognized on her brother\\'s shoulders the military cloak of her betrothed, which she herself had woven, she loosed her hair and, weeping, called on her dead lover\\'s name.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> It enraged the fiery youth to hear his sister\\'s lamentations in the hour of his own victory and the nation\\'s great rejoicing. And so, drawing his sword and at the same time angrily upbraiding her, he ran her through the body.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> <quote>Begone</quote> he cried, <quote>to your betrothed, with your ill-timed love, since you have forgot your brothers, both the dead and the living, and forgot your country!\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> So perish every Roman woman who mourns a foe!</quote>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Horrid as this deed seemed to the Fathers and the people, his recent service was an off-set to it; nevertheless he was seized and brought before the king for trial. The king, that he might not take upon himself the responsibility for so stern and unpopular a judgement, and for the punishment which must follow <pb id=\"p.93\"/>sentence, called together the council of the people<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 672-640</note> and said: <quote>In accordance with the law I appoint duumvirs to pass judgement upon Horatius for treason.</quote><note>By taking it upon himself to punish his sister, Horatius had usurped a function of the state, and so was guilty of treason.</note>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> The dread formula of the law ran thus: <quote>Let the duumvirs pronounce him guilty of treason; if he shall appeal from the duumvirs, let the appeal be tried; if the duumvirs win, let the lictor veil his head; let him bind him with a rope to a barren tree; let him scourge him either within or without the pomerium.</quote><note>I have adopted the view of Oldfather (<hi rend=\"italics\">T.A.P.A.</hi> xxxix. pp. 49 ff.) that neither hanging nor crucifixion is meant, but that the culprit was fastened to the tree and scourged to death.</note>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/> By the terms of this law duumvirs were appointed. They considered that they might not acquit, under that act, even one who was innocent, and having given a verdict of guilty, one of them pronounced the words, <quote>Publius Horatius, I adjudge you a traitor; go, lictor, bind his hands.</quote>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"8\"/> The lictor had approached and was about to fit the noose. Then Horatius, at the prompting of Tullus, who put a merciful construction upon the law, cried, <quote>I appeal!</quote>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"9\"/> And so the appeal was tried before the people. What influenced men most of all in that trial was the assertion of Publius Horatius, the father, that his daughter had been justly slain; otherwise he should have used a father\\'s authority and have punished his son, himself. He then implored them not to make him childless whom they had beheld a little while before surrounded by a goodly offspring.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"10\"/> So saying, the old man embraced the youth, and pointing to the spoils of the Curiatii set up in the place which is now called <quote>the Horatian Spears,</quote><note>The name of the place which commemorated the spoils reflects the tradition, rejected above by Livy, that the Horatii were Albans, the Curiatii Romans.</note> he exclaimed, <quote>This man you saw but lately advancing <pb id=\"p.95\"/>decked with spoils and triumphing in his victory;<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 672-640</note> can you bear, Quirites, to see him bound beneath a fork and scourged and tortured? Hardly could Alban eyes endure so hideous a sight.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"11\"/> Go, lictor, bind the hands which but now, with sword and shield, brought imperial power to the Roman People! Go, veil the head of the liberator of this city! Bind him to a barren tree! Scourge him within the pomerium, if you will &mdash;so it be amidst yonder spears and trophies of our enemies &mdash;or outside the pomerium &mdash;so it be amongst the graves of the Curiatii! For whither can you lead this youth where his own honours will not vindicate him from so foul a punishment?</quote>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"12\"/> The people could not withstand the father\\'s tears, or the courage of Horatius himself, steadfast in every peril; and they acquitted him, more in admiration of his valour than from the justice of his cause. And so, that the flagrant murder might yet be cleansed away, by some kind of expiatory rite, the father was commanded to make atonement for his son at the public cost.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"13\"/> He therefore offered certain piacular sacrifices, which were thenceforward handed down in the Horatian family, and, erecting a beam across the street, to typify a yoke, he made his son pass under it, with covered head. It remains to this day, being restored from time to time at the state\\'s expense, and is known as <quote>the Sister\\'s Beam.</quote>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"14\"/> Horatia\\'s tomb, of hewn stone, was built on the place where she had been struck down.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t',\n",
       " '\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>But the peace with Alba did not last long. The discontent of the people, who criticized the dictator for having confided the nation\\'s welfare to three soldiers, broke down his weak character, and since honest measures had proved unsuccessful, <pb id=\"p.97\"/>he resorted to evil ones to regain the favour of his<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 672-640</note> countrymen.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> Accordingly, just as in war he had sought peace, so now in time of peace he desired war. But seeing that his own state was richer in courage than in strength, he stirred up other tribes to make war openly after due declaration; while for his own people he reserved the part of the traitor under the disguise of friendship.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> The men of Fidenae, a Roman colony, and the Veientes, whom they admitted to a share in their designs, were induced to commence hostilities by a promise that the Albans would go over to their side.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> Fidenae having openly revolted, Tullus summoned Mettius and his army from Alba, and led his forces against the enemy. Crossing the Anio, he pitched his camp at the confluence of the rivers. The Veientine army had crossed the Tiber between that place and Fidenae.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> These troops, drawn up next the river, formed the right wing; on the left the Fidenates were posted, nearer the mountains. Tullus marshalled his own men against the Veientine enemy; the Albans he posted opposite the army of Fidenae. The Alban commander was as wanting in courage as in loyalty. Not daring, therefore, either to hold his ground or openly to desert, he drew off by imperceptible degrees in the direction of the mountains.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> Then, when he thought he had got near enough to them, he brought up his whole battle-line to an elevated position, and still irresolute, deployed his ranks with the object of consuming time. His purpose was to swing his forces to the side which fortune favoured.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/> At first the Romans posted next to the Albans were amazed when they perceived that their flank was being uncovered by the withdrawal of their allies; then a <pb id=\"p.99\"/>horseman galloped up to the king, and told him that<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 672-640</note> the Albans were marching off. In this crisis Tullus vowed to establish twelve Salian priests,<note>These were the so-called <hi rend=\"italics\">Collini,</hi> or <hi rend=\"italics\">Agonales,</hi> and were associated with Quirinus, as the <hi rend=\"italics\">Palatini</hi> (chap. xx.) were with Mars Gradivus.

This man&oelig;uvre hid the retreat of the Alban army from a large part of the Roman foot-soldiers; those who had seen it, believing what the king had been heard to say, fought all the more impetuously. The enemy in their turn now became alarmed; they had heard Tullus\\'s loud assertion, and many of the Fidenates, having had Romans among them as colonists, knew Latin.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"10\"/> And so, lest the Albans should suddenly charge down from the hills and cut them off from their town, they beat a retreat. Tullus pressed them hard, and having routed the wing composed of the Fidenates, returned, bolder than ever, to the Veientes, who were demoralized by the panic of their neighbours.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"11\"/> They, too, failed to withstand his attack, but their rout was stopped by the river in their rear When they had fled thus far, some basely threw away their arms and rushed blindly into the water, others hesitated on the bank and were overtaken before they had made up their minds whether to flee or resist.

       " '\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>Then the Alban army, which had been a<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 672-640</note> spectator of the battle, was led down into the plain. Mettius congratulated Tullus on the conquest of his enemies; Tullus replied kindly to Mettius, and commanded the Albans in a good hour to join their camp to that of the Romans.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> He then made preparations to perform, on the morrow, a sacrifice of purification. At dawn, when all things were in readiness, he issued to both armies the customary order, convoking them to an assembly.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> The heralds, beginning at the outskirts of the camp, called out the Albans first, who being moved by the very novelty of the occasion, took their stand close to the Roman king, that they might hear him harangue his army.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> The Roman troops, by previous arrangement, were armed and disposed around them, and the centurions were bidden to execute orders promptly.

Such were the Julii, the Servilii, the Quinctii, the Geganii, the Curiatii, and the Cloelii. He also built, as a consecrated place for the order he had enlarged, a senate-house, which continued to be called the Curia Hostilia as late as the time of our own fathers.<note>When Clodius was murdered, in <date value=\"-52\">52 B.C.</date>, the mob burnt his body in the Curia Hostilia, which caught fire and was destroyed.</note>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> And that all the orders might gain some strength from the new people, he enrolled ten squadrons of knights<note>Each squadron contained thirty men.

On either side there had been aggressions and refusals to grant satisfaction.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> Tullus complained that at the shrine of Feronia, in a crowded fair, Roman traders had been seized; the Sabines alleged that, before this, refugees from their country had fled to the grove of sanctuary, and had been detained in Rome.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> These were put forward as the causes of war.

Ancus Marcius was a grandson, on the mother\\'s side, of King Numa Pompilius.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> When he began to rule he was mindful of his grandfather\\'s glory, and considered that the last reign, excellent in all else, had failed to prosper in one respect, owing to neglect or misconduct of religious observances. Deeming it therefore a matter of the utmost consequence to perform the state sacrifices as Numa had established them, he bade the pontifex copy out all these from the commentaries of the king and display them in public on a whitened table. This act led the citizens, who were eager for peace, <pb id=\"p.115\"/>and also the neighbouring nations, to hope that he<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 640-616</note> would adopt the character and institutions of his grandfather.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> Hence the Latins, with whom a treaty had been made in the time of Tullus, plucked up courage, and raided Roman territory, and when called on by the Romans to make restitution, returned an arrogant answer, persuaded that the Roman king would spend his reign in inactivity amid shrines and altars. But the character of Ancus was well balanced, and he honoured the memory of Romulus, as well as Numa.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> And besides having a conviction that peace had been more necessary to his grandfather\\'s reign, when the nation had been both young and mettlesome, he also believed that the tranquillity, so free of attack, which had fallen to the lot of Numa would be no easy thing for himself to compass; his patience was being tried, and when proved would be regarded with contempt, and in short the times were better suited to the rule of a Tullus than a Numa.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> In order however that, as Numa had instituted religious practices in time of peace, he might himself give out a ceremonial of war, and that wars might not only be waged but also declared with some sort of formality, he copied from the ancient tribe of the Aequicoli the law, which the fetials now have,<note>The institution of the fetials was ascribed in chap. xxiv. to Tullus (so also Cic. <hi rend=\"italics\">Rep.</hi> ii. 31).

These people, in order that the Aventine might be connected with the Palatine, were made to settle in the region of the Altar of Murcia.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> Janiculum was also annexed to the city, not from any lack of room, but lest it might some day become a stronghold of Rome\\'s enemies. It was decided not only to fortify it, but also to connect it with the City, for greater ease in passing to and fro, by a bridge of piles, the first bridge ever built over the Tiber.<note>This was the famous Pons Sublicius, <quote>Pile Bridge,</quote> made of wood, without metal of any sort.</note>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/> The Quirites\\' Ditch also, no small protection on the more level and accessible side of town, was the work of King Ancus.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p><milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"8\"/>When these enormous additions to the community had been effected, it was found that in so great a multitude the distinction between right and wrong had become obscured, and crimes were being secretly committed.

Happening to settle in Tarquinii, he had married there and had two sons, named Lucumo and Arruns. Lucumo survived his father and inherited all his property; Arruns died before his father, leaving his wife with child.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> Demaratus did not long survive Arruns, and, unaware that his son\\'s wife was to become a mother, he died without making provision for his grandson in his will. When the babe was born his grandfather was dead, and having no share in the inheritance, he was given the name of Egerius,<note><hi rend=\"italics\">i.e.</hi> <quote>Necessitous.</quote></note> in consequence of his penniless condition.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> Lucumo, on the other hand, was heir to the whole estate. The self-confidence implanted in his bosom by his wealth was heightened by his marriage with Tanaquil, who was a woman of the most exalted birth, and not of a character lightly to endure a humbler rank in her new environment than she had <pb id=\"p.125\"/>enjoyed in the condition to which she had been born.<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 640-616</note>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> The Etruscans looked with disdain on Lucumo, the son of a banished man and a stranger. She could not endure this indignity, and forgetting the love she owed her native land, if she could only see her husband honoured, she formed the project of emigrating from Tarquinii.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> Rome appeared to be the most suitable place for her purpose; amongst a new people, where all rank was of sudden growth and founded on worth, there would be room for a brave and strenuous man; the City had been ruled by Tatius the Sabine, it had summoned Numa to the sovereignty from Cures, even Ancus was the son of a Sabine mother, and could point to no noble ancestor but Numa.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/> She had no trouble in persuading a man who was eager for distinction, to whom Tarquinii was only his mother\\'s birthplace.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"8\"/> They therefore gathered their possessions together and removed to Rome. They had come, as it happened, as far as Janiculum, when, as they were sitting in their covered waggon, an eagle poised on its wings gently descended upon them and plucked off Lucumo\\'s cap, after which, rising noisily above the car and again stooping, as if sent from heaven for that service, it deftly replaced the cap upon his head, and departed on high.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"9\"/> This augury was joyfully accepted, it is said, by Tanaquil, who was a woman skilled in celestial prodigies, as was the case with most Etruscans. Embracing her husband, she bade him expect transcendent greatness: such was the meaning of that bird, appearing from that quarter of the sky, and bringing tidings from that god; the highest part of the man had been concerned in the omen; the eagle had removed the adornment placed upon a mortal\\'s head that it might <pb id=\"p.127\"/>restore it with the divine approbation.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"10\"/> Such were<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 640-616</note> their hopes and their reflections as they entered the City. Having obtained a house, they gave out the name of Lucius Tarquinius Priscus.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"11\"/> The Romans regarded him with special interest, as a stranger and a man of wealth, and he steadily pushed his fortune by his own exertions, making friends wherever possible, by kind words, courteous hospitality, and benefactions, until his reputation extended even to the palace.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"12\"/> He had not long been known in this way to the king before the liberality and adroitness of his services procured him the footing of an intimate friend. He was now consulted in matters both of public and private importance, in time of war and in time of peace, and having been tested in every way was eventually even named in the king\\'s will as guardian of his children.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t',\n",

By this time his sons were nearly grown. Tarquinius was therefore all the more insistent in urging that the comitia should be held without delay to choose a king.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> When the meeting had been proclaimed, and the day drew near, he sent the boys away on a hunting expedition. Tarcuinius was the first, they say, to canvass votes for the kingship and to deliver a speech designed to win the favour of the commons.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> He pointed out that it; was no new thing he sought; he was not the first outsider to aim at the sovereignty in Rome &mdash;a thing which might have occasioned indignation and astonishment, &mdash;but the third.

In subordination and deference to the king he had vied, he said, with all his hearers; in generosity to his fellow-subjects he had emulated the king himself.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> Hearing him advance these not unwarranted claims, the people, with striking unanimity, named him king. The result was that the man, so admirable in all other respects, continued even after he had obtained the sovereignty to manifest the same spirit of intrigue which had governed him in seeking it; and being no less concerned to strengthen his own power than to enlarge the state, he added a hundred members to the senate, who were known thenceforward as Fathers of the <quote>lesser families,</quote> and formed a party of unwavering loyalty to the king, to whom they owed their admission to the Curia.<note>The senate had doubtless shown its disapproval of the accession of Tarquinius, who now sought to render its opposition futile by doubling the membership and appointing none but his own supporters.</note>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p><milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/>His first war was with the Latins, whose town of Apiolae he took by storm.

The enemy then withdrew into their camp, affording the Romans an opportunity to renew their preparations for the war. Tarquinius believed that cavalry was what he chiefly lacked. To the Ramnes, Titienses, and Luceres, the centuries which Romulus had enrolled, he therefore determined to add others, and to give them his own name as a permanent distinction.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> But since this was a matter in which Romulus had obtained the sanction of augury before acting, it was asserted by Attus Navius, a famous augur of those days, that no change or innovation could be introduced unless the birds had signified their approval.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> The king\\'s ire was aroused by this, and he is reported to have said, in derision of the science, <quote>Come now, divine seer!

And in this, besides being increased in strength, the Roman army was further helped by a stratagem, for men were secretly dispatched to light a great quantity of firewood lying on the bank of the Anio, and throw it into the river. A favouring wind set the wood in a blaze, and the greater part of it lodged against the boats and piles, where it stuck fast and <pb id=\"p.135\"/>set the bridge on fire.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> This was another source of<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 616-578</note> alarm to the Sabines during the battle, and upon their being routed the same thing hindered their flight, so that many of them escaped the Romans only to perish in the stream; while their shields floated down the Tiber toward the City, and, being recognized, gave assurance that a victory had been won almost sooner than the news of it could be brought.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> In this battle the cavalry particularly distinguished themselves. They were posted on either flank of the Romans, and when the centre, composed of infantry, was already in retreat, they are said to have charged from both sides, with such effect that they not only checked the Sabine forces, which were pressing hotly forward as their enemy gave way, but suddenly put them to flight.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> The Sabines made for the mountains in a scattered rout, and indeed a few gained that refuge.

Soon afterwards sleep left him, and with it disappeared the flames.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> Then, taking her husband aside, Tanaquil said: <quote>Do you see this child whom we are bringing up in so humble a fashion?

Let us therefore rear with all solicitude one who will lend high renown to the state and to our family.</quote>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> It is said that from that moment the boy began to be looked upon as a son, and to be trained in the studies by which men are inspired to bear themselves greatly. It was a thing easily accomplished, being the will of Heaven. The youth turned out to be of a truly royal nature, and when Tarquinius sought a son-in-law there was no other young Roman who could be at all compared to Servius; and the king accordingly betrothed his daughter to him.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> This great honour, for whatever cause conferred on him, forbids us to suppose that <pb id=\"p.141\"/>his mother was a slave and that he himself had been<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 616-578</note> in a state of servitude as a child. I am rather of the opinion of those who say, that on the capture of Corniculum, when Servius Tullius, the chief man of that city, had been slain, his wife, who was great with child, had been recognized amongst the other captive women, and on the score of her unique nobility had been rescued from slavery by the Roman queen, and had brought forth her child at Rome in the house of Priscus Tarquinius;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> in the sequel this act of generosity led to a growing intimacy between the women, and the boy, as one reared from childhood in the palace, was held in affection and esteem; it was his mother\\'s misfortune, who by the capture of her native town came into the power of its enemies, which gave rise to the belief that Servius was born of a slave woman.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t',\n",

It would<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 616-578</note> be not only a general disgrace to the Roman name, but particularly to their own house, if during the lifetime of Ancus\\' sons it should be open not only to strangers, but even to slaves to rule over the Romans.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> They therefore determined to repel that insult with the sword. But resentment at their wrong urged them rather against Tarquinius himself than against Servius, not only because the king, if he survived, would be more formidable to avenge the murder than a subject would be, but because if Servius should be dispatched it seemed probable that the kingdom would be inherited by whomsoever else Tarquinius might choose to be his son-in-law. For these reasons they laid their plot against the king himself.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> Two very desperate shepherds were selected to do the deed. Armed with the rustic implements to which they were both accustomed, they feigned a brawl in the entrance-court of the palace and, making as much noise as possible, attracted the attention of all the royal attendants; then they appealed to the king, until their shouts were heard inside the palace and they were sent for and came before him.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> At first each raised his voice and tried to shout the other down.

Then there was an uproar, as crowds hurried to the scene, asking one another in amazement what the matter was. In the midst of the tumult Tanaquil gave orders to close the palace, and ejected all witnesses. She busily got together the remedies needful for healing a wound, as if there were still hope, taking at the same time other measures to protect herself in case her hope should fail her.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> Having hastily summoned Servius, she showed him her husband\\'s nearly lifeless body, and grasping his right hand, besought him not to suffer the death of his father-in-law to go unpunished, nor his mother-in-law to become a jest to her enemies.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> <quote>To you, Servius,</quote> she cried, <quote>if you are a man, belongs this kingdom, not to those who by the hands of others have committed a dastardly crime.

In this way for several days after Tarquinius had breathed his last he concealed his death, pretending that he was merely doing another\\'s work, while he was really strengthening his own position; then at last the truth was allowed to be known, from the lamentations which arose within the palace. Servius surrounded himself with a strong guard, and ruled at first without the authorization of the people, but with the consent of the Fathers.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/> The sons of Ancus, upon the arrest of the agents of their crime and the report that the king was alive and that Servius was so strong, had already gone into voluntary exile at Suessa Pometia.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t',\n",

The arms prescribed for them were an oblong shield in place of the round one, and everything else, save for the breast-plate, as in the class above.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> He fixed the rating of the third class at fifty thousand; a like number of centuries was formed in this class as in the second, and with the same distinction of ages; neither was any change made in their arms, except that the greaves were omitted.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> In the fourth class the rating was twenty-five thousand; the same number of centuries was formed, but their equipment was changed, nothing being given them but a spear and a javelin.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/> The fifth class was made larger, and thirty centuries were formed. These men carried slings, with stones for missiles. Rated with them were the horn-blowers and trumpeters, divided into two centuries. Eleven thousand was the rating of this class.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"8\"/> Those who were assessed at less than this amount, being all the rest of the population, were made into a single century, exempt from military service. When the <pb id=\"p.153\"/>equipment and distribution of the infantry had been<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 578-534</note> thus provided for, Servius enrolled twelve centuries of knights out of the leading men of the state.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"9\"/> He likewise formed six other centuries &mdash;three had been instituted by Romulus &mdash;employing the same names which had been hallowed to their use by augury. For the purchase of horses they were allowed ten thousand asses each from the state treasury, and for the maintenance of these horses unmarried women were designated, who had to pay two thousand asses each, every year. All these burdens were shifted from the shoulders of the poor to those of the rich.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"10\"/> The latter were then granted special privileges: for manhood suffrage, implying equality of power and of rights, was no longer given promiscuously to all, as had been the practice handed down by Romulus and observed by all the other kings; but gradations were introduced, so that ostensibly no one should be excluded from the suffrage, and yet the power should rest with the leading citizens.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"11\"/> For the knights were called upon to vote first; then the eighty centuries of the first class: if there were any disagreement there, which rarely happened, it was provided that the centuries of the second class should be called; and they almost never descended so far as to reach the lowest citizens.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"12\"/> Nor ought it to cause any surprise that the present organization, which exists since the increase of the tribes to thirty-five, and the doubling of their number in the matter of the junior and senior centuries, does not correspond with the total established by Servius Tullius.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"13\"/> For, having divided the City according to its inhabited regions and hills into four parts, he named them <quote>tribes,</quote> a word <pb id=\"p.155\"/>derived, I suppose, from <quote>tribute</quote>;<note><hi rend=\"italics\">Tributum</hi> comes from <hi rend=\"italics\">tribus</hi> (not <hi rend=\"italics\">vice versa,</hi> as Livy has it), which meant originally <quote>third part,</quote> but lost the numerical force and became simply <quote>part,</quote> <quote>district,</quote> like the French <quote><hi rend=\"italics\">quartier,</hi></quote> which Walde compares.</note> for this<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 578-534</note> likewise the same king planned to have apportioned equitably, on the basis of the census; nor had these tribes anything whatever to do with the distribution or the number of the centuries.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t',\n",

This was termed the <quote>closing of the lustrum,</quote> because it was the last act in the enrolment. Eighty thousand citizens are said to have been registered in that census; the most ancient of the historians, Fabius Pictor, adds that this was the number of those capable of bearing arms.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> To meet the wants of this population it was apparent that the City must expand, and so the king added two hills, the Quirinal and the Viminal, after which he proceeded to enlarge the Esquiline,<note>Dion. iv. 13, and Strabo, v. 3, 7, make Servius the first to include the Esquiline in the City.

It was reputed to have been built through the cooperation of the cities of Asia, and this harmony and community of worship Servius praised in superlative terms to the Latin nobles, with whom, both officially and in private, he had taken pains to establish a footing of hospitality and friendship.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> By dint of reiterating the same arguments he finally carried his point, and a shrine of Diana was built in Rome by the nations of Latium conjointly with the Roman People. This was an admission that Rome was the capital &mdash;a point which had so often been disputed <pb id=\"p.159\"/>with force of arms. But though it seemed that the<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 578-534</note> Latins had lost all interest in this contention after the repeated failure of their appeals to war, there was one man amongst the Sabines who thought that he saw an opportunity to recover the empire by a shrewd plan of his own.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> In the Sabine country, on the farm of a certain head of a family, there was born a heifer of extraordinary size and beauty;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> a marvel to which the horns afterwards bore testimony, for they were fastened up for many generations in the vestibule of Diana\\'s temple.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> This heifer was regarded as a prodigy, as indeed it was; soothsayers prophesied that the state whose citizens should sacrifice the animal to Diana would be the seat of empire, and this prediction had reached the ears of the priest of Diana\\'s shrine. On the earliest day which seemed suitable for the sacrifice, the Sabine drove the heifer to Rome, and bringing her to the shrine of Diana, led her up to the altar. There the Roman priest, moved by the great size of the victim, which had been much talked of, and recalling the prophecy, asked the Sabine, <quote>What is this that you are doing, stranger?

       " '\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>Servius had by this time a definite prescriptive right to the supreme power. Still, hearing <pb id=\"p.161\"/>that the young Tarquinius now and then threw out<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 578-534</note> a hint that he was reigning without the consent of the people, he proceeded to gain the goodwill of the commons by dividing among all the citizens the land obtained by conquest from the enemy; after which he made bold to call upon the people to vote whether he should be their ruler, and was declared king with such unanimity as none of his predecessors had experienced.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> Yet the circumstance did not lessen Tarquinius\\'s hopes of obtaining the kingship. On the contrary, perceiving that the bestowal of land on the plebeians was in opposition to the wishes of the senate, he felt that he had got the better opportunity of vilifying Servius to the Fathers and of increasing his own influence in the senate-house. He was a hot-headed youth himself, and he had at hand, in the person of Tullia his wife, one who goaded on his restless spirit.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> For the royal house of Rome produced an example of tragic guilt, as others had done,<note>The reference is to the stories of Atreus and Oedipus.</note> in order that loathing of kings might hasten the coming of liberty, and that the end of reigning might come in that reign which was the fruit of crime.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> This Lucius Tarquinius &mdash;whether he was the son or the grandson of King Tarquinius Priscus is uncertain; but, following the majority of historians, I would designate him son &mdash;had a brother, Arruns Tarquinius, a youth of a gentle disposition.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> These two, as has been said before, had married the two Tullias, daughters of the king, themselves of widely different characters. Chance had so ordered matters that the two violent natures should not be united in wedlock, thanks doubtless to the good fortune of the Roman People, that the reign of Servius might be prolonged and the traditions of <pb id=\"p.163\"/>the state become established.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> It was distressing to<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 578-534</note> the headstrong Tullia that her husband should be destitute of ambition and enterprise. With her whole soul she turned from him to his brother; him she admired, him she called a man and a prince: she despised her sister because, having got a man for a mate, she lacked a woman\\'s daring.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/> Their similarity soon brought these two together, as is generally the case, for evil is strongly drawn to evil; but it was the woman who took the lead in all the mischief. Having become addicted to clandestine meetings with another\\'s husband, she spared no terms of insult when speaking of her own husband to his brother, or of her sister to that sister\\'s husband. She urged that it would have been juster for her to be unmarried and for him to lack a wife than for them to be united to their inferiors and be compelled to languish through the cowardice of others.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"8\"/> If the gods had given her the man she deserved she would soon have seen in her own house the royal power which she now saw in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"9\"/> her father\\'s. It was not long before she had inspired the young man with her own temerity, and, having made room in their respective houses for a new marriage, by deaths which followed closely upon one another, they were joined together in nuptials which Servius rather tolerated than approved.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t',\n",

Inspired by this woman\\'s frenzy Tarquinius began to go about and solicit support, especially among the heads of the lesser families, whom he reminded of his father\\'s kindness to them, and desired their favour in return; the young men he attracted by gifts; both by the great things he promised to do <pb id=\"p.167\"/>himself, and by slandering the king as well, he<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 578-534</note> everywhere strengthened his interest.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/> At length, when it seemed that the time for action was now come, he surrounded himself with a body of armed men and burst into the Forum.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"8\"/> Then, amidst the general consternation which ensued, he seated himself on the throne in front of the Curia, and commanded, by the mouth of a herald, that the senators should come to King Tarquinius at the senate-house. They at once assembled: some of them already prepared beforehand, others afraid that they might be made to suffer for it if they did not come; for they were astounded at this strange and wonderful sight, and supposed that Servius was utterly undone.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"9\"/> Tarquinius then went back to the very beginning of Servius\\'s family and abused the king for a slave and a slave-woman\\'s son who, after the shameful death of his own father, Tarquinius Priscus, had seized the power;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"10\"/> there had been no observance of the interregnum, as on former occasions; there had been no election held; not by the votes of the people had sovereignty come to him, not with the confirmation of the Fathers, but by a woman\\'s gift.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"11\"/> Such having been his birth, and such his appointment to the kingship, he had been an abettor of the lowest class of society, to which he himself belonged, and his hatred of the nobility possessed by others had led him to plunder the leading citizens of their land and divide it amongst the dregs of the populace.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"12\"/> All the burdens which had before been borne in common he had laid upon the nation\\'s foremost men.

Shouts arose from the partisans of each, and the people began to rush into the senate-house; it was clear that he would be king who won the day.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> Tarquinius was now compelled by sheer necessity to go on boldly to the end. Being much superior to Servius in youth and strength, he seized him by the middle, and bearing him out of the senate-house, flung him down the steps.

There had been much talk in the council all day about various subjects. Turnus Herdonius of Aricia had inveighed violently against the absent Tarquinius.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> He said it was no wonder he had been given the name of Superbus at Rome &mdash;for that was the name by which they already called him, secretly and in whispers, but still quite generally; &mdash;could anything be more overbearing than to flout the whole Latin race as he was doing then?\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> Their leaders had been summoned from distant homes, and the very man who had called the council was not there.

If they were guided by the speaker they would depart every man to his own home, nor observe the day of meeting more than he who had proclaimed it was observing it.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/> As these <pb id=\"p.177\"/>words and others of the same import were being<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 534-510</note> uttered by the factious and turbulent Latin, who owed to these qualities his influence amongst his own people, Tarquinius came up.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"8\"/> This was the end of the speech; all turned to salute Tarquinius. Silence was commanded, and the king, being advised by those nearest him to excuse himself for having come so late, declared that he had been chosen arbiter between a father and his son, and had been delayed by his anxiety to reconcile them. He added that since this business had used up that day, he would take up on the morrow the matters which he had meant to bring before them.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"9\"/> They say that Turnus would not suffer even this to go unchallenged, asserting that there was no question more quickly settled than one betwixt father and son, for these few words were enough to end it: <quote>Unless you obey your father it will be the worse for you.</quote>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t',\n",

Through the agency of certain men of the opposite party in Aricia, he bribed a slave of Turnus with gold to allow a large quantity of swords to be brought secretly into his master\\'s lodging.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> Having accomplished this in a single night, Tarquinius, shortly before dawn, summoned the chief men of the Latins to his quarters, pretending to <pb id=\"p.179\"/>have received alarming news, and informed them<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 534-510</note> that his tardiness on the preceding day, as though somehow providentially occasioned, had been the means of saving himself and them.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> For he was told that Turnus was plotting his murder and that of the chief men of the different cities, that he might be sole ruler over the Latins. He would have attacked them the day before in the council, but had postponed the attempt because the summoner of the council, whom he chiefly aimed at, was not there.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> That was the reason Turnus had railed at him in his absence, for his delay had balked the Arician\\'s expectation. Tarquinius said that he had no doubt, if his information was true, that Turnus would come at dawn, when they had assembled in the council, and would be armed and attended by a band of conspirators.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> It was said that a great quantity of swords had been carried to his lodging; the falsity or truth of this could be ascertained immediately, and he asked them to go with him to Turnus\\'s quarters.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/> The charge was made plausible both by the aggressive spirit of Turnus and his speech of the day before, and by Tarquinius\\'s delay, since it seemed that the massacre might have been postponed on that account. The nobles went therefore with a disposition to believe the story, but still, if the swords should not be found, they were prepared to conclude the other charges false.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"8\"/> As soon as they reached the place they wakened Turnus from his sleep and surrounded him with guards; and having overpowered the slaves, who out of affection for their master would have resorted to force, they proceeded to pull out the hidden swords from every corner of the inn. There was now no doubt that Turnus was <pb id=\"p.181\"/>caught in the act, and he was cast into chains, while<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 534-510</note> the summons was instantly sent out, amidst intense excitement, for a council of the Latins.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"9\"/> There such bitter resentment was aroused by the public display of the swords, that the accused was not permitted to plead his cause, but suffered a new kind of death, being plunged into the source of the Ferentine Water and sunk beneath a wicker crate heaped up with stones.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t',\n",

War, however, he did take it upon himself to urge, again and again; and in so doing he assumed a special competence, as one who was acquainted with the strength of both nations, and knew that the king\\'s pride must necessarily be hateful to all the citizens, since even his children had not been able to put up with it.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> In this way, little by little, he stirred up the leaders of the Gabini to reopen the war. He would himself take the boldest of the young men and go upon raids and forays.

Skirmishes took place between Rome and Gabii, in which, as a rule, the Gabini had the best of it.

For whereas the birds permitted that the consecrations of all the other shrines should be rescinded, they refused their consent for the shrine of Terminus.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> This omen and augury was thus construed: the fact that the seat of Terminus was not moved, and that of all the gods he alone was not called away from the place consecrated to him, meant that the whole kingdom would be firm and steadfast.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> When this auspice of permanence had been received, there followed another prodigy foretelling the grandeur of their empire.

He enlarged the pomerium; added to the city\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Quirinal, Viminal, and Esquiline Hills; and with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Latins erected a temple to Diana on the Aventine.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHe was killed by Lucius Tarquinius, son of Priscus, on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe advice of his own daughter Tullia, after reigning\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t44 years.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>After him Lucius Tarquinius Superbus seized the kingdom, without the authorization of either Fathers or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPeople. He kept armed men about him to protect him.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHe waged war with the Volsci, and out of their spoils\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbuilt a temple to Jupiter on the Capitol. He brought\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tGabii under his sway by guile. When his sons had gone\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tto Delphi and were consulting the oracle as to which of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<pb id=\"p.215\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthem should be king in Rome, answer was made that he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tshould reign who should first kiss his mother. This\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tresponse the princes themselves explained otherwise, but\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tJunius Brutus, who had accompanied them, pretended to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tfall upon his face, and kissed the earth. And the outcome sanctioned his act. For when Tarquinius Superbus\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\thad brought all men to hate him by the violence of his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbehaviour, and finally Lucretia, whose chastity had been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tviolated at night by the king\\'s son Sextus, summoned her\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tfather Tricipitinus and her husband Collatinus and, adjuring them not to leave her death unavenged, killed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\therself with a knife, Tarquinius was expelled, chiefly\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthrough the efforts of Brutus, after a reign of 25 years.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThen the first consuls were chosen, Lucius Junius Brutus\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<pb id=\"p.219\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div1>\\n\\t\\t\\t']"

From this point the tradition follows two lines. Some say that Latinus, having been defeated in the battle, made a peace with Aeneas, and later an alliance of marriage. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t',\n",

       "'<head>Livy from the Founding of the City: Book I</head>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p><milestone unit=\"chapter\" n=\"pr\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>Whether I am likely to accomplish anything worthy of the labour, if I record the achievements of the Roman people from the foundation of the city, I do not really know, nor if I knew would I dare to avouch it;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> perceiving as I do that the theme<note>Some scholars take <hi rend=\"italics\">rem</hi> to mean <quote>the practice,</quote> <hi rend=\"italics\">sc.</hi> of expressing confidence in one\\'s ability.</note> is not only old but hackneyed, through the constant succession of new historians, who believe either that in their facts they can produce more authentic information, or that in their style they will prove better than the rude attempts of the ancients.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> Yet, however this shall be, it will be a satisfaction to have done myself as much as lies in me to commemorate the deeds of the foremost people of the world; and if in so vast a company of writers my own reputation should be obscure, my consolation would be the fame and greatness of those whose renown will throw mine into the shade.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> Moreover, my subject involves infinite labour, seeing that it must be traced back <pb id=\"p.5\"/>above seven hundred years, and that proceeding from slender beginnings it has so increased as now to be burdened by its own magnitude; and at the same time I doubt not that to most readers the earliest origins and the period immediately succeeding them will give little pleasure, for they will be in haste to reach these modern times, in which the might of a people which has long been very powerful is working its own undoing.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> I myself, on the contrary, shall seek in this an additional reward for my toil, that I may avert my gaze from the troubles which our age has been witnessing for so many years, so long at least as I am absorbed in the recollection of the brave\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> days of old, free from every care which, even if it could not divert the historian\\'s mind from the truth, might nevertheless cause it anxiety.<note>Livy refers to the animosities inevitably aroused by writers who dealt with such thorny subjects as the civil wars, during the lifetime of many who had taken part in them.</note>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p><milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/>Such traditions as belong to the time before the city was founded, or rather was presently to be founded, and are rather adorned with poetic legends than based upon trustworthy historical proofs, I purpose neither to affirm nor to refute. It is the privilege of antiquity to mingle divine things with human, and so to add dignity to the beginnings of cities;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"8\"/> and if any people ought to be allowed to consecrate their origins and refer them to a divine source, so great is the military glory of the Roman People that when they profess that their Father and the Father of their Founder was none other than Mars, the nations of the earth may well submit to this also with as good a grace as they submit to Rome\\'s dominion.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"9\"/> But to such legends as these, however they shall be regarded and judged, I shall, for my own part, attach no great importance. Here are the questions to which I would have every reader <pb id=\"p.7\"/>give his close attention &mdash;what life and morals were like; through what men and by what policies, in peace and in war, empire was established and enlarged; then let him note how, with the gradual relaxation of discipline, morals first gave way, as it were, then sank lower and lower, and finally began the downward plunge<note>The metaphor is from a decaying building.</note> which has brought us to the present time, when we can endure neither our vices nor their cure.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p><milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"10\"/>What chiefly makes the study of history wholesome and profitable is this, that you behold the lessons of every kind of experience set forth as on a conspicuous monument;<note>The monument Livy means is the body of a nation\\'s achievements (<hi rend=\"italics\">cf. res</hi> in &sect; 1), the <quote>history</quote> of a nation, in that objective sense of the word. This he likens to a monument of stone on which men\\'s deeds are recorded.</note> from these you may choose for yourself and for your own state what to imitate, from these mark for avoidance what is shameful in the conception and shameful in the result.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"11\"/> For the rest, either love of the task I have set myself deceives me, or no state was ever greater, none more righteous or richer in good examples, none ever was where avarice and luxury came into the social order so late, or where humble means and thrift were so highly esteemed and so long held in honour.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"12\"/> For true it is that the less men\\'s wealth was, the less was their greed. Of late, riches have brought in avarice, and excessive pleasures the longing to carry wantonness and licence to the point of ruin for oneself and of universal destruction.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>But complaints are sure to be disagreeable, even when they shall perhaps be necessary; let the beginning, at all events, of so great an enterprise have none.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"13\"/> With good omens rather would we begin, and, if historians had the same custom which poets have, <pb id=\"p.9\"/>with prayers and entreaties to the gods and goddesses, that they might grant us to bring to a successful issue the great task we have undertaken.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"chapter\" n=\"1\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>First of all, then, it is generally agreed that when Troy was taken vengeance was wreaked upon the other Trojans, but that two, Aeneas and Antenor, were spared all the penalties of war by the Achivi, owing to long-standing claims of hospitality, and because they had always advocated peace and the giving back of Helen.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> They then experienced various vicissitudes. Antenor, with a company of Eneti who had been expelled from Paphlagonia in a revolution and were looking for a home and a leader &mdash;for they had lost their king, Pylaemenes, at Troy<note>See the <hi rend=\"italics\">Iliad,</hi> v. 576.</note> &mdash;came to the inmost bay of the Adriatic.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> There, driving out the Euganei, who dwelt between the sea and the Alps, the Eneti and Trojans took possession of those lands. And in fact the place where they first landed is called Troy, and the district is therefore known as Trojan, while the people as a whole are called the Veneti.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> Aeneas, driven from home by a similar misfortune, but guided by fate to undertakings of greater consequence, came first to Macedonia; thence was carried, in his quest of a place of settlement, to Sicily; and from Sicily laid his course towards the land of Laurentum. This place too is called Troy.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> Landing there, the Trojans, as men who, after their all but immeasurable wanderings, had nothing left but their swords and ships, were driving booty from the fields, when King Latinus and the Aborigines, who then occupied that country, rushed down from their city and their fields to repel with arms the violence of the invaders. From this point the tradition follows two <pb id=\"p.11\"/>lines. Some say that Latinus, having been defeated in the battle, made a peace with Aeneas, and later an alliance of marriage.<note>This, in a nutshell, is the form of the legend on which Virgil based Books vii.-xii. of the <hi rend=\"italics\">Aeneid.</hi></note>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> Others maintain that when the opposing lines had been drawn up, Latinus did not wait for the charge to sound, but advanced amidst his chieftains and summoned the captain of the strangers to a parley.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/> He then inquired what men they were, whence they had come, what mishap had caused them to leave their home, and what they sought in landing on the coast of Laurentum.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"8\"/> He was told that the people were Trojans and their leader Aeneas, son of Anchises and Venus; that their city had been burnt, and that, driven from home, they were looking for a dwelling-place and a site where they might build a city. Filled with wonder at the renown of the race and the hero, and at his spirit, prepared alike for war or peace, he gave him his right hand in solemn pledge of lasting friendship.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"9\"/> The commanders then made a treaty, and the armies saluted each other. Aeneas became a guest in the house of Latinus; there the latter, in the presence of his household gods, added a domestic treaty to the public one, by giving his daughter in marriage to Aeneas.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"10\"/> This event removed any doubt in the minds of the Trojans that they had brought their wanderings to an end at last in a permanent and settled habitation.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"11\"/> They founded a town, which Aeneas named Lavinium, after his wife. In a short time, moreover, there was a male scion of the new marriage, to whom his parents gave the name of Ascanius.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"chapter\" n=\"2\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>War was then made upon Trojans and Aborigines alike. Turnus was king of the Rutulians, and to him Lavinia had been betrothed before the coming <pb id=\"p.13\"/>of Aeneas. Indignant that a stranger should be preferred before him, he attacked, at the same time, both Aeneas and Latinus.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> Neither army came off rejoicing from that battle. The Rutulians were beaten: the victorious Aborigines and Trojans lost their leader Latinus.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> Then Turnus and the Rutulians, discouraged at their situation, fled for succour to the opulent and powerful Etruscans and their king Mezentius, who held sway in Caere, at that time an important town. Mezentius had been, from the very beginning, far from pleased at the birth of the new city; he now felt that the Trojan state was growing much more rapidly than was altogether safe for its neighbours, and readily united his forces with those of the Rutulians.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> Aeneas, that he might win the goodwill of the Aborigines to confront so formidable an array, and that all might possess not only the same rights but also the same name, called both nations Latins;<note>Virgil makes Jupiter grant, as a favour to Juno, that the Trojan name shall be sunk in the Latin (<hi rend=\"italics\">Aen.</hi> xii. 835).</note> and from that time on the Aborigines were no less ready and faithful than the Trojans in the service of King Aeneas.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> Accordingly, trusting to this friendly spirit of the two peoples, which were growing each day more united, and, despite the power of Etruria, which had filled with the glory of her name not only the lands but the sea as well, along the whole extent of Italy from the Alps to the Sicilian Strait, Aeneas declined to defend himself behind his walls, as he might have done, but led out his troops to battle.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> The fight which ensued was a victory for the Latins: for Aeneas it was, besides, the last of his mortal labours. He lies buried, whether it is fitting and right <pb id=\"p.15\"/>to term him god or man, on the banks of the river Numicus; men, however, call him Jupiter Indiges.<note><hi rend=\"italics\">Indiges</hi> means <quote>of or belonging to a certain place</quote> (Fowler, <hi rend=\"italics\">Fest.</hi> p. 192). Dion. Hal. i. 64, says that the Latins made a shrine to Aeneas with an inscription in which he was called <foreign lang=\"greek\">path\\\\r xqo/nios</foreign>(<hi rend=\"italics\">Pater Indiges</hi>). He was also called <hi rend=\"italics\">Deus Indiges</hi> and <hi rend=\"italics\">Aeneas Indiges.</hi></note>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"chapter\" n=\"3\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>Ascanius, Aeneas\\' son, was not yet ripe for authority; yet the authority was kept for him, unimpaired, until he arrived at manhood. Meanwhile, under a woman\\'s regency, the Latin State and the kingdom of his father and his grandfather stood unshaken &mdash;so strong was Lavinia\\'s character &mdash;until the boy could claim it.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> I shall not discuss the question &mdash;for who could affirm for certain so ancient a matter? &mdash;whether this boy was Ascanius, or an elder brother, born by Creusa while Ilium yet stood, who accompanied his father when he fled from the city, being the same whom the Julian family call lulus and claim as the author of their name.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> This Ascanius, no matter where born, or of what mother &mdash;it is agreed in any case that he was Aeneas\\' son &mdash;left Lavinium, when its population came to be too large, for it was already a flourishing and wealthy city for those days, to his mother, or stepmother, and founded a new city himself below the Alban Mount.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> This was known from its position, as it lay stretched out along the ridge, by the name of Alba Longa. From the settlement of Lavinium to the planting of the colony at Alba Longa was an interval of some thirty years.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> Yet the nation had grown so powerful, in consequence especially of the defeat of the Etruscans, that even when Aeneas died, and even when a woman became its regent and a boy began his apprenticeship as king, neither Mezentius and his Etruscans nor any other neighbours dared to attack them.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> Peace had been agreed to on these terms, that the River Albula, which men now call the Tiber, should be the boundary <pb id=\"p.17\"/>between the Etruscans and the Latins.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/> Next Silvius reigned, son of Ascanius, born, as it chanced, in the forest. He begat Aeneas Silvius, and he Latinus Silvius. By him several colonies were planted, and called the Ancient Latins.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"8\"/> Thereafter the cognomen Silvius was retained by all who ruled at Alba. From Latinus came Alba, from Alba Atys, from Atys Capys, from Capys Capetus, from Capetus Tiberinus.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"9\"/> This last king was drowned in crossing the River Albula, and gave the stream the name which has been current with later generations. Then Agrippa, son of Tiberinus, reigned, and after Agrippa Romulus Silvius was king, having received the power from his father. Upon the death of Romulus by lightning, the kingship passed from him to Aventinus. This king was buried on that hill, which is now a part of the City of Rome, and gave his name to the hill.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"10\"/> Proca ruled next. He begat Numitor and Amulius; to Numitor, the elder, he bequeathed the ancient realm of the Silvian family. Yet violence proved more potent than a father\\'s wishes or respect for seniority. Amulius drove out his brother and ruled in his stead.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"11\"/> Adding crime to crime, he destroyed Numitor\\'s male issue; and Rhea Silvia, his brother\\'s daughter, he appointed a Vestal under pretence of honouring, her, and by consigning her to perpetual virginity, deprived her of the hope of children.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"chapter\" n=\"4\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>But the Fates were resolved, as I suppose, upon the founding of this great City, and the beginning of the mightiest of empires, next after that of Heaven.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> The Vestal was ravished, and having given birth to twin sons, named Mars as the father of her doubtful offspring, whether actually so believing, or because it seemed less wrong if a god <pb id=\"p.19\"/>were the author of her fault.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> But neither gods nor men protected the mother herself or her babes from the king\\'s cruelty; the priestess he ordered to be manacled and cast into prison, the children to be committed to the river.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> It happened by singular good fortune that the Tiber having spread beyond its banks into stagnant pools afforded nowhere any access to the regular channel of the river, and the men who brought the twins were led to hope that being infants they might be drowned, no matter how sluggish the stream.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> So they made shift to discharge the king\\'s command, by exposing the babes at the nearest point of the overflow, where the fig-tree Ruminalis &mdash;formerly, they say, called Romularis &mdash;now stands.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> In those days this was a wild and uninhabited region. The story persists that when the floating basket in which the children had been exposed was left high and dry by the receding water, a she-wolf, coming down out of the surrounding hills to slake her thirst, turned her steps towards the cry of the infants, and with her teats gave them suck so gently, that the keeper of the royal flock found her licking them with her tongue.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/> Tradition assigns to this man the name of Faustulus, and adds that he carried the twins to his hut and gave them to his wife Larentia to rear. Some think that Larentia, having been free with her favours, had got the name of <quote>she-wolf</quote> among the shepherds, and that this gave rise to this marvellous story.<note>The word <hi rend=\"italics\">lupa</hi> was sometimes used in the sense of <quote>courtesan.</quote></note>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"8\"/> The boys, thus born and reared, had no sooner attained to youth than they began &mdash;yet without neglecting the farmstead or the flocks &mdash;to range the glades of the mountains for game.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"9\"/> Having in this way gained both strength and resolution, they would now not <pb id=\"p.21\"/>only face wild beasts, but would attack robbers laden with their spoils, and divide up what they took from them among the shepherds, with whom they shared their toils and pranks, while their band of young men grew larger every day.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"chapter\" n=\"5\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>They say that the Palatine was even then the scene of the merry festival of the Lupercalia which we have to-day, and that the hill was named Pallantium, from Pallanteum, an Arcadian city, and then Palatium.<note>The derivation here given is fanciful. The word is probably akin to <hi rend=\"italics\">palus,</hi> <quote>pale,</quote> and meant a <quote>fenced place.</quote></note>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> There Evander, an Arcadian of that stock, who had held the place many ages before the time of which I am writing, is said to have established the yearly rite, derived from Arcadia, that youths should run naked about in playful sport, doing honour to Lycaean Pan, whom the Romans afterwards called Inuus.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> When the young men were occupied in this celebration, the rite being generally known, some robbers who had been angered by the loss of their plunder laid an ambush for them, and although Romulus successfully defended himself, captured Remus and delivered up their prisoner to King Amulius, even lodging a complaint against him.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> The main charge was that the brothers made raids on the lands of Numitor, and pillaged them, with a band of young fellows which they had got together, like an invading enemy.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> So Remus was given up to Numitor to be punished. From the very beginning Faustulus had entertained the suspicion that they were children of the royal blood that he was bringing up in his house; for he was aware both that infants had been exposed by order of the king, and that the time when he had himself taken up the children exactly coincided with that event. But he had been unwilling that the <pb id=\"p.23\"/>matter should be disclosed prematurely, until opportunity offered or necessity compelled.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> Necessity came first; accordingly, driven by fear, he revealed the facts to Romulus. It chanced that Numitor too, having Remus in custody, and hearing that the brothers were twins, had been reminded, upon considering their age and their far from servile nature, of his grandsons. The inquiries he made led him to the same conclusion, so that he was almost ready to acknowledge Remus. Thus on every hand the toils were woven about the king.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/> Romulus did not assemble his company of youths &mdash;for he was not equal to open violence &mdash;but commanded his shepherds to come to the palace at an appointed time, some by one way, some by another, and so made his attack upon the king; while from the house of Numitor came Remus, with another party which he had got together, to help his brother. So Romulus slew the king. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"chapter\" n=\"6\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>At the beginning of the fray Numitor exclaimed that an enemy had invaded the city and attacked the palace, and drew off the active men of the place to serve as an armed garrison for the defence of the citadel; and when he saw the young men approaching, after they had dispatched the king, to congratulate him, he at once summoned a council, and laid before it his brother\\'s crimes against himself, the parentage of his grandsons, and how they had been born, reared, and recognised.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> He then announced the tyrant\\'s death, and declared himself to be responsible for it. The brothers advanced with their band through the midst of the crowd, and hailed their grandfather king, whereupon such a shout of assent arose from the entire throng as confirmed the new monarch\\'s title and authority.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/><pb id=\"p.25\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>The Alban state being thus made over to Numitor, Romulus and Remus were seized with the desire to found a city in the region where they had been exposed and brought up. And in fact the population of Albans and Latins was too large; besides, there were the shepherds. All together, their numbers might easily lead men to hope that Alba would be small, and Lavinium small, compared with the city which they should build.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> These considerations were interrupted by the curse of their grandsires, the greed of kingly power, and by a shameful quarrel which grew out of it, upon an occasion innocent enough. Since the brothers were twins, and respect for their age could not determine between them, it was agreed that the gods who had those places in their protection should choose by augury who should give the new city its name, who should govern it when built. Romulus took the Palatine for his augural quarter, Remus the Aventine. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"chapter\" n=\"7\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>Remus<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 753</note> is said to have been the first to receive an augury, from the flight of six vultures. The omen had been already reported when twice that number appeared to Romulus. Thereupon each was saluted king by his own followers, the one party laying claim to the honour from priority, the other from the number of the birds.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> They then engaged in a battle of words and, angry taunts leading to bloodshed, Remus was struck down in the affray. The commoner story is that Remus leaped over the new walls in mockery of his brother, whereupon Romulus in great anger slew him, and in menacing wise added these words withal, <quote><hi rend=\"italics\">So</hi> perish whoever else shall leap over my walls!</quote><note>A form of the legend preserved by Dion. Hal. i. 87, and Ovid, <hi rend=\"italics\">Fasti,</hi> iv. 843, names Celer, whom Romulus had put in charge of the rising wall, as the slayer of Remus.</note>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> Thus Romulus acquired sole power, and the city, thus founded, was called by its founder\\'s name.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> <pb id=\"p.27\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>His first act was to fortify the Palatine, on which<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 753</note> he had himself been reared. To other gods he sacrificed after the Alban custom, but employed the Greek for Hercules, according to the institution of Evander.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> The story is as follows: Hercules, after slaying Geryones, was driving off his wondrously beautiful cattle, when, close to the river Tiber, where he had swum across it with the herd before him, he found a green spot, where he could let the cattle rest and refresh themselves with the abundant grass; and being tired from his journey he lay down himself.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> When he had there fallen into a deep sleep, for he was heavy with food and wine, a shepherd by the name of Cacus, who dwelt hard by and was insolent by reason of his strength, was struck with the beauty of the animals, and wished to drive them off as plunder. But if he had driven the herd into his cave, their tracks would have been enough to guide their owner to the place in his search; he therefore chose out those of the cattle that were most remarkable for their beauty, and turning them the other way, dragged them into the cave by their tails.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> At daybreak Hercules awoke. Glancing over the herd, and perceiving that a part of their number was lacking, he proceeded to the nearest cave, in case there might be foot-prints leading into it. When he saw that they were all turned outward and yet did not lead to any other place, he was confused and bewildered, and made ready to drive his herd away from that uncanny spot.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/> As the cattle were being driven off, some of them lowed, as usually happens, missing those which had been left behind. They were answered with a low by the cattle shut up in the cave, and this made Hercules turn back. When he came towards the <pb id=\"p.29\"/>cave, Cacus would have prevented his approach with<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 753</note> force, but received a blow from the hero\\'s club, and calling in vain upon the shepherds to protect him, gave up the ghost.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"8\"/> Evander, an exile from the Peloponnese, controlled that region in those days, more through personal influence than sovereign power. He was a man revered for his wonderful invention of letters,<note>Evander is said to have invented the Roman alphabet.</note> a new thing to men unacquainted with the arts, and even more revered because of the divinity which men attributed to his mother Carmenta, whom those tribes had admired as a prophetess before the Sibyl\\'s coming into Italy.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"9\"/> Now this Evander was then attracted by the concourse of shepherds, who, crowding excitedly about the stranger, were accusing him as a murderer caught red-handed. When he had been told about the deed and the reason for it, and had marked the bearing of the man and his figure, which was somewhat ampler and more august than a mortal\\'s, he inquired who lie was.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"10\"/> Upon learning his name, his father, and his birth-place, he exclaimed, <quote>Hail, Hercules, son of Jupiter! You are he, of whom my mother, truthful interpreter of Heaven, foretold to me that you should be added to the number of the gods, and that an altar should be dedicated to you here which the nation one day to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"11\"/> be the most powerful on earth should call the Greatest Altar, and should serve according to your rite.</quote>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"12\"/> Hercules gave him his hand, and declared that he accepted the omen, and would fulfil the prophecy by establishing and dedicating an altar. Then and there men took a choice victim from the herd, and for the first time made sacrifice to Hercules.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"13\"/> For the ministry and the banquet they employed the Potitii and the Pinarii, being the families <pb id=\"p.31\"/>of most distinction then living in that region. It so<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 753</note> fell out that the Potitii were there at the appointed time, and to them were served the inwards; the Pinarii came after the inwards had been eaten, in season for the remainder of the feast.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"14\"/> Thence came the custom, which persisted as long as the Pinarian family endured, that they should not partake of the inwards at that sacrifice. The Potitii, instructed by Evander, were priests of this cult for many generations, until, having delegated to public slaves the solemn function of their family, the entire stock of the Potitii died out.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"15\"/> This was the only sacred observance, of all those of foreign origin, which Romulus then adopted, honouring even then the immortality won by worth to which his own destiny was leading him.<note>For the story of Cacus and the origin of the Ara Maxima see also Virgil, <hi rend=\"italics\">Aen.</hi> viii. 182-279; Prop. iv. 9; Ovid, <hi rend=\"italics\">Fasti,</hi> i. 543-586.</note>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"chapter\" n=\"8\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>When Romulus had duly attended to the worship of the gods, he called the people together and gave them the rules of law, since nothing else but law could unite them into a single body politic.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> But these, he was persuaded, would only appear binding in the eyes of a rustic people in case he should invest his own person with majesty, by adopting emblems of authority. He therefore put on a more august state in every way, and especially by the assumption of twelve lictors.<note>The lictors carried axes in bundles of rods, in readiness to execute the king\\'s sentence of scourging and decapitation.</note>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> Some think the twelve birds which had given him an augury of kingship led him to choose this number. For my part, I am content to share the opinion of those who derive from the neighbouring Etruscans (whence were borrowed the curule chair and purple-bordered toga) not only the type of attendants but their number as well &mdash;a number which the Etruscans themselves are thought to have chosen because each <pb id=\"p.33\"/>of the twelve cities which united to elect the king<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 753</note> contributed one lictor.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p><milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/>Meanwhile the City was expanding and reaching out its walls to include one place after another, for they built their defences with an eye rather to the population which they hoped one day to have than to the numbers they had then.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> Next, lest his big City should be empty, Romulus resorted to a plan for increasing the inhabitants which had long been employed by the founders of cities, who gather about them an obscure and lowly multitude and pretend that the earth has raised up sons to them. In the place which is now enclosed, between the two groves as you go up the hill,<note><hi rend=\"italics\">i.e.</hi> the Capitoline.</note> he opened a sanctuary.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> Thither fled, from the surrounding peoples, a miscellaneous rabble, without distinction of bond or free, eager for new conditions; and these constituted the first advance in power towards that greatness at which Romulus aimed.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/> He had now no reason to be dissatisfied with his strength, and proceeded to add policy to strength. He appointed a hundred senators, whether because this number seemed to him sufficient, or because there were no more than a hundred who could be designated Fathers.<note>As being heads of clans, <hi rend=\"italics\">patresfamiliarum.</hi></note> At all events, they received the designation of Fathers from their rank, and their descendants were called patricians.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"chapter\" n=\"9\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>Rome was now strong enough to hold her own<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 753-717</note> in war with any of the adjacent states; but owing to the want of women a single generation was likely to see the end of her greatness, since she had neither prospect of posterity at home nor the right of intermarriage with her neighbours.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> So, on the advice of the senate, Romulus sent envoys round among all the neighbouring nations to solicit for the new people <pb id=\"p.35\"/>an alliance and the privilege of intermarrying.<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 753-717</note>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> Cities, they argued, as well as all other things, take their rise from the lowliest beginnings. As time goes on, those which are aided by their own worth and by the favour of Heaven achieve great power and renown.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> They said they were well assured that Rome\\'s origin had been blessed with the favour of Heaven, and that worth would not be lacking; their neighbours should not be reluctant to mingle their stock and their blood with the Romans, who were as truly men as they were.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> Nowhere did the embassy obtain a friendly hearing. In fact men spurned, at the same time that they feared, both for themselves and their descendants, that great power which was then growing up in their midst; and the envoys were frequently asked, on being dismissed, if they had opened a sanctuary for women as well as for men, for in that way only would they obtain suitable wives.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> This was a bitter insult to the young Romans, and the matter seemed certain to end in violence. Expressly to afford a fitting time and place for this, Romulus, concealing his resentment, made ready solemn games in honour of the equestrian Neptune, which he called Consualia.<note>The Consualia was a harvest festival, held on August 21. Consus, the true name of the god, is from <hi rend=\"italics\">condere,</hi> <quote>to store up.</quote> From the association of the festival with horses came the later identification of the god with <hi rend=\"italics\">Neptunus Equester.</hi> See Fowler, <hi rend=\"italics\">Fest.</hi> pp. 206-9.</note>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/> He then bade proclaim the spectacle to the surrounding peoples, and his subjects prepared to celebrate it with all the resources within their knowledge and power, that they might cause the occasion to be noised abroad and eagerly expected.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"8\"/> Many people &mdash;for they were also eager to see the new city &mdash;gathered for the festival, especially those who lived nearest, the inhabitants of Caenina, Crustumium, and Antemnae.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"9\"/> The Sabines, <pb id=\"p.37\"/>too, came with all their people, including their<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 753-717</note> children and wives. They were hospitably entertained in every house, and when they had looked at the site of the City, its walls, and its numerous buildings, they marvelled that Rome had so rapidly grown great.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"10\"/> When the time came for the show, and people\\'s thoughts and eyes were busy with it, the preconcerted attack began. At a given signal the young Romans darted this way and that, to seize and carry off the maidens.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"11\"/> In most cases these were taken by the men in whose path they chanced to be. Some, of exceptional beauty, had been marked out for the chief senators, and were carried off to their houses by plebeians to whom the office had been entrusted.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"12\"/> One, who far excelled the rest in mien and loveliness, was seized, the story relates, by the gang of a certain Thalassius. Being repeatedly asked for whom they were bearing her off, they kept shouting that no one should touch her, for they were taking her to Thalassius, and this was the origin of the wedding-cry.<note>Plutarch, <hi rend=\"italics\">Rom.</hi> 15, also gives the story, and observes that the Romans used <quote>Talasius</quote> as the Greeks did <quote>Hymenaeus.</quote> See also Catullus, lxi. 134.</note>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"13\"/> The sports broke up in a panic, and the parents of the maidens fled sorrowing. They charged the Romans with the crime of violating hospitality, and invoked the gods to whose solemn games they had come, deceived in violation of religion and honour.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"14\"/> The stolen maidens were no more hopeful of their plight, nor less indignant. But Romulus himself went amongst them and explained that the pride of their parents had caused this deed, when they had refused their neighbours the right to intermarry; nevertheless the daughters should be wedded and become co-partners in all the possessions of the Romans, in their citizenship and, dearest privilege of all to the human race, in their children; <pb id=\"p.39\"/>only let them moderate their anger, and give their<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 753-717</note> hearts to those to whom fortune had given their persons.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"15\"/> A sense of injury had often given place to affection, and they would find their husbands the kinder for this reason, that every man would earnestly endeavour not only to be a good husband, but also to console his wife for the home and parents she had lost.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"16\"/> His arguments were seconded by the wooing of the men, who excused their act on the score of passion and love, the most moving of all pleas to a woman\\'s heart.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"chapter\" n=\"10\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>The resentment of the brides was already much diminished at the very moment when their parents, in mourning garb and with tears and lamentations, were attempting to arouse their states to action. Nor did they confine their complaints to their home towns, but thronged from every side to the house of Titus Tatius, king of the Sabines; and thither, too, came official embassies, for the name of Tatius was the greatest in all that country.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> The men of Caenina, Crustumium, and Antemnae, were those who had had a share in the wrong. It seemed to them that Tatius and the Sabines were procrastinating, and without waiting for them these three tribes arranged for a joint campaign.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> But even the Crustuminians and Antemnates moved too slowly to satisfy the burning anger of the Caeninenses, and accordingly that nation invaded alone the Roman territory. But while they were dispersed and engaged in pillage, Romulus appeared with his troops and taught them, by an easy victory, how ineffectual is anger without strength.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> Their army he broke and routed, and pursued it as it fled; their king he killed <pb id=\"p.41\"/>in battle and despoiled; their city, once their leader<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 753-717</note> was slain, he captured at the first assault.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> He then led his victorious army back, and being not more splendid in his deeds than willing to display them, he arranged the spoils of the enemy\\'s dead commander upon a fame, suitably fashioned for the purpose, and, carrying it himself, mounted the Capitol. Having there deposited his burden, by an oak which the shepherds held sacred, at the same time as he made his offering he marked out the limits of a temple to Jupiter, and bestowed a title upon him.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> <quote>Jupiter Feretrius,</quote> he said, <quote>to thee I, victorious Romulus, myself a king, bring the panoply of a king, and dedicate a sacred precinct within the bounds which I have even now marked off in my mind, to be a seat for the spoils of honour which men shall bear hither in time to come, following my example, when they have slain kings and commanders of the enemy.</quote>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/> This was the origin of the first temple that was consecrated in Rome.<note>Jupiter Feretrius (etymology unknown) was the pure Italian Jupiter, whose worship was later overshadowed by the Etruscan god of the great temple on the Capitol. See Fowler, <hi rend=\"italics\">Fest.</hi> p. 229.</note> It pleased Heaven, in the sequel, that while the founder\\'s words should not be in vain, when he declared that men should bring spoils thither in the after time, yet the glory of that gift should not be staled by a multitude of partakers. Twice only since then, in all these years with their many wars, have the spoils of honour been won; so rarely have men had the good fortune to attain to that distinction.<note>The other instances were the victories of Cossus over Tolumnius, king of Veii (iv. 20), and of Marcellus over Virdomarus, king of the Insubrian Gauls. Propertius tells the three stories in iv. 10.</note>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"chapter\" n=\"11\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>While the Romans were thus occupied in the City, the army of the Antemnates seized the opportunity afforded by their absence, and made an inroad upon their territory; but so swiftly was the Roman <pb id=\"p.43\"/>levy led against them that they, too, were taken off<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 753-717</note> their guard while scattered about in the fields.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> They were therefore routed at the first charge and shout, and their town was taken. As Romulus was exulting in his double victory, his wife Hersilia, beset with entreaties by the captive women, begged him to forgive their parents and receive them into the state; which would, in that case, gain in strength by harmony.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> He readily granted her request. He then set out to meet the Crustuminians, who were marching to attack him. They offered even less resistance than their allies had done, for their ardour had been quenched by the defeats of the others.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> Colonies were sent out to both places, though most of the colonists preferred to enrol for Crustumium on account of the fertility of its soil.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> On the other hand, many persons left Crustumium and came to live in Rome, chiefly parents and kinsmen of the captured women.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>The last to attack Rome were the Sabines, and this war was by far the gravest of all, for passion and greed were not their motives, nor did they parade war before they made it.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> To their prudence they even added deception. Spurius Tarpeius commanded the Roman citadel. This man\\'s maiden daughter was bribed with gold by Tatius to admit armed men into the fortress: she happened at that time to have gone outside the walls to fetch water for a sacrifice.<note>As a vestal, she had to draw water from the spring of the Camenae.</note>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/> Once within, they threw their shields upon her and killed her so, whether to make it appear that the citadel had been taken by assault, or to set an example, that no one might anywhere keep faith with a traitor.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"8\"/> There is also a legend that because most of the Sabines wore heavy golden <pb id=\"p.45\"/>bracelets on their left arms and magnificent jewelled<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 753-717</note> rings, she had stipulated for what they had on their left arms, and that they had therefore heaped their shields upon her, instead of gifts of gold.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"9\"/> Some say that, in virtue of the compact that they should give her what they wore on their arms, she flatly demanded their shields and, her treachery being perceived, forfeited her life to the bargain she herself had struck.<note>According to Dion. Hal. ii. 38, this was the version given by L. Calpurnius Piso. Propertius wrote the best of his aetiological poems (iv. 5) about Tarpeia.</note>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"chapter\" n=\"12\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>Be that as it may, the Sabines held the citadel. Next day the Roman army was drawn up, and covered the ground between the Palatine Hill and the Capitoline, but the Sabines would not come down till rage and eagerness to regain the citadel had goaded their enemy into marching up the slope against them.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> Two champions led the fighting, the Sabine Mettius Curtius on the one side, and the Roman Hostius Hostilius on the other. Hostius held the Romans firm, despite their disadvantage of position, by the reckless courage he displayed in the thick of the fray.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> But when he fell, the Roman line gave way at once and fled towards the old gate of the Palatine. Romulus himself was swept along in the crowd of the fugitives, till lifting his sword and shield to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> heaven, he cried, <quote>O Jupiter, it was thy omen that directed me when I laid here on the Palatine the first foundations of my City. The fortress is already bought by a crime and in the possession of the Sabines, whence they are come, sword in hand, across the valley to seek us here.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> But do thou, father of gods and men, keep them back from this spot at least; deliver the Romans from their terror, and stay their shameful flight!\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> I here vow to thee, Jupiter the Stayer, a temple, to be a <pb id=\"p.47\"/>memorial to our descendants how the City was saved<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 753-717</note> by thy present help.</quote>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/> Having uttered this prayer he exclaimed, as if he had perceived that it was heard, <quote>Here, Romans, Jupiter Optimus Maximus commands us to stand and renew the fight!</quote> The Romans did stand, as though directed by a voice from Heaven, Romulus himself rushing into the forefront of the battle.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"8\"/> Mettius Curtius, on the Sabine side, had led the charge down from the citadel, and driven the Romans in disorder over all that ground which the Forum occupies. He was not now far from the gate of the Palatine, shouting, <quote>We have beaten our faithless hosts, our cowardly enemies! They know now how great is the difference between carrying off maidens and fighting with men!</quote> While he pronounced this boast a band of gallant youths, led on by Romulus, assailed him.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"9\"/> It chanced that Mettius was fighting on horseback at the time, and was therefore the more easily put to flight. As he fled, the Romans followed; and the rest of their army, too, fired by the reckless daring of their king, drove the Sabines before them.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"10\"/> Mettius plunged into a swamp, his horse becoming unmanageable in the din of the pursuit, and even the Sabines were drawn off from the general engagement by the danger to so great a man. As for Mettius, heartened by the gestures and shouts of his followers and the encouragement of the throng, he made his escape; and the Romans and the Sabines renewed their battle in the valley that lies between the two hills. But the advantage rested with the Romans.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"chapter\" n=\"13\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>Then the Sabine women, whose wrong had given rise to the war, with loosened hair and torn <pb id=\"p.49\"/>garments, their woman\\'s timidity lost in a sense of<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 753-717</note> their misfortune, dared to go amongst the flying missiles, and rushing in from the side, to part the hostile forces and disarm them of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> their anger, beseeching their fathers on this side, on that their husbands, that fathers-in-law and sons-in-law should not stain themselves with impious bloodshed, nor pollute with parricide the suppliants\\' children, grandsons to one party and sons to the other.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> <quote>If you regret,</quote> they continued, <quote>the relationship that unites you, if you regret the marriage-tie, turn your anger against us; we are the cause of war, the cause of wounds, and even death to both our husbands and our parents. It will be better for us to perish than to live, lacking either of you, as widows or as orphans.</quote>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> It was a touching plea, not only to the rank and file, but to their leaders as well. A stillness fell on them, and a sudden hush. Then the leaders came forward to make a truce, and not only did they agree on peace, but they made one people out of the two.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> They shared the sovereignty, but all authority was transferred to Rome. In this way the population was doubled, and that some concession might after all be granted the Sabines, the citizens were named Quirites, from the town of Cures.<note><hi rend=\"italics\">Quirites</hi> probably comes not from Cures, nor (as Varro thought) from the Sabine word <hi rend=\"italics\">quiris (curis),</hi> <quote>spear,</quote> but from <hi rend=\"italics\">curia</hi> (<hi rend=\"italics\">cf.</hi> next section); it would then mean <quote>wardsmen.</quote></note>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> As a reminder of this battle they gave the name of Curtian Lake to the pool where the horse of Curtius first emerged from the deep swamp and brought his rider to safety.<note>For another explanation of the name see vii. 6. Varro, <hi rend=\"italics\">L. L.</hi> v. 14 ff., assigns this version of the story to Piso, the other to Procilius, adding a third, on the authority of Cornelius and Lutatius, to the effect that the Lacus Curtius was a place which had been struck by lightning in the consulship of a Curtius.</note>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>The sudden exchange of so unhappy a war for a joyful peace endeared the Sabine women even more to their husbands and parents, and above all to <pb id=\"p.51\"/>Romulus himself.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/> And so, when he divided the<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 753-717</note> people into thirty <hi rend=\"italics\">curiae,</hi> he named these wards after the women.<note>The <hi rend=\"italics\">curia</hi> was a political unit the members of which had certain religious rites in common.</note> Undoubtedly the number of the women was somewhat greater than this, but tradition does not tell whether it was their age, their own or their husbands\\' rank, or the casting of lots, that determined which of them should give their names to the wards.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"8\"/> At the same time there were formed three centuries of knights: the Ramnenses were named after Romulus; the Titienses after Titus Tatius; the name and origin of the Luceres are alike obscure.<note>All three names are obscure, but it is not improbable that they represent a Roman, a Sabine, and an Etruscan element in the population.</note> From this time forth the two kings ruled not only jointly but in harmony.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"chapter\" n=\"14\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>Some years later the kinsmen of King Tatius maltreated the envoys of the Laurentians, and when their fellow-citizens sought redress under the law of nations, Titus yielded to his partiality for his relations and to their entreaties.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> In consequence of this he drew down their punishment upon himself, for at Lavinium, whither he had gone to the annual sacrifice, a mob came together and killed him.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> This act is said to have awakened less resentment than was proper in Romulus, whether owing to the disloyalty that attends a divided rule, or because he thought Tatius had been not unjustly slain. He therefore declined to go to war; but yet, in order that he might atone for the insults to the envoys and the murder of the king, he caused the covenant between Rome and Lavinium to be renewed.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p><milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/>Thus with the Laurentians peace was preserved against all expectation; but another war broke out, much nearer, and indeed almost at the city gates. The men of Fidenae, perceiving the growth of a power which they thought too near themselves for <pb id=\"p.53\"/>safety, did not wait till its promised strength should<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 753-717</note> be realized, but began war themselves. Arming the young men, they sent them to ravage the land between the City and Fidenae.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> Thence they turned to the left &mdash;for the Tiber stopped them on the right &mdash;and by their devastations struck terror into the farmers, whose sudden stampede from the fields into the City brought the first tidings of war.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> Romulus led forth his army on the instant, for delay was impossible with the enemy so near, and pitched his camp a mile from Fidenae. Leaving there a small guard, he marched out with all his forces.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/> A part of his men he ordered to lie in ambush, on this side and on that, where thick underbrush afforded cover; advancing with the greater part of the infantry and all the cavalry, and delivering a disorderly and provoking attack, in which the horsemen galloped almost up to the gates, he accomplished his purpose of drawing out the enemy. For the flight, too, which had next to be feigned, the cavalry engagement afforded a favourable pretext.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"8\"/> And when not only the cavalry began to waver, as if undecided whether to fight or run, but the infantry also fell back, the city gates were quickly thronged by the enemy, who poured out and hurled themselves against the Roman line, and in the ardour of attack and pursuit were drawn on to the place of ambuscade.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"9\"/> There the Romans suddenly sprang out and assailed the enemy\\'s flanks, while, to add to their terror, the standards of the detachment which had been left on guard were seen advancing from the camp; thus threatened by so many dangers the men of Fidenae scarcely afforded time for Romulus and those whom they had seen riding off with him to wheel about, before they <pb id=\"p.55\"/>broke and ran, and in far greater disorder than that<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 753-717</note> of the pretended fugitives whom they had just been chasing &mdash;for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"10\"/> the flight was a real one this time &mdash; sought to regain the town.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"11\"/> But the Fidenates did not escape their foes; the Romans followed close upon their heels, and before the gates could be shut burst into the city, as though they both formed but a single army.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"chapter\" n=\"15\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>From Fidenae the war-spirit, by a kind of contagion, spread to the Veientes, whose hostility was aroused by their kinship with the Fidenates, Etruscans like themselves, and was intensified by the danger which lay in their very proximity to Rome, if her arms should be directed against all her neighbours.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> They made an incursion into Roman territory which more resembled a marauding expedition than a regular campaign; and so, without having entrenched a camp or waited for the enemy\\'s army, they carried off their booty from the fields and brought it back to Veii. The Romans, on the contrary, not finding their enemy in the fields, crossed the Tiber, ready and eager for a decisive struggle.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> When the Veientes heard that they were making a camp, and would be advancing against their city, they went out to meet them, preferring to settle the quarrel in the field of battle rather than to be shut up and compelled to fight for their homes and their town.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> Without employing strategy to aid his forces, the Roman king won the battle by the sheer strength of his seasoned army, and routing his enemies, pursued them to their walls. But the city was strongly fortified, besides the protection afforded by its site, and he refrained from attacking it.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> Their fields, indeed, he laid waste as he returned, more in <pb id=\"p.57\"/>revenge than from a desire for booty, and this disaster,<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 753-717</note> following upon their defeat, induced the Veientes to send envoys to Rome and sue for peace. They were deprived of a part of their land, and a truce was granted them for a hundred years.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p><milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/>Such were the principal achievements of the reign of Romulus, at home and in the field, nor is any of them incompatible with the belief in his divine origin and the divinity which was ascribed to the king after his death, whether one considers his spirit in recovering the kingdom of his ancestors, or his wisdom in founding the City and in strengthening it by warlike and peaceful measures.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/> For it was to him, assuredly, that Rome owed the vigour which enabled her to enjoy an untroubled peace for the next forty years.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"8\"/> Nevertheless, he was more liked by the commons than by the senate, and was preeminently dear to the hearts of his soldiers. Of these he had three hundred for a bodyguard, to whom he gave the name of Celeres,<note>Literally, <quote>the .Swift.</quote></note> and kept them by him, not only in war, but also in time of peace.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"chapter\" n=\"16\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>When these deathless deeds had been done,<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 716</note> as the king was holding a muster in the Campus Martius, near the swamp of Capra, for the purpose of reviewing the army, suddenly a storm came up, with loud claps of thunder, and enveloped him in a cloud so thick as to hide him from the sight of the assembly; and from that moment Romulus was no more on earth.<note>For the deification <hi rend=\"italics\">cf.</hi> Cic. <hi rend=\"italics\">de Rep.</hi> ii. 17; Dion. Hal. ii. 56; Plut. <hi rend=\"italics\">Rom.</hi> xxvii. Ovid also tells the story in <hi rend=\"italics\">Fasti,</hi> ii. 491 ff., and <hi rend=\"italics\">Met.</hi> xiv. 806 ff.</note>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> The Roman soldiers at length recovered from their panic, when this hour of wild confusion had been succeeded by a sunny calm; but when they saw that the royal seat was empty, although they readily believed the assertion of the senators, who had been standing next to Romulus, <pb id=\"p.59\"/>that he had been caught up on high in the blast, they<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 716</note> nevertheless remained for some time sorrowful and silent, as if filled with the fear of orphanhood.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> Then, when a few men had taken the initiative, they all with one accord hailed Romulus as a god and a god\\'s son, the King and Father of the Roman City, and with prayers besought his favour that he would graciously be pleased forever to protect his children.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> There were some, I believe, even then who secretly asserted that the king had been rent in pieces by the hands of the senators, for this rumour, too, got abroad, but in very obscure terms; the other version obtained currency, owing to men\\'s admiration for the hero and the intensity of their panic.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> And the shrewd device of one man is also said to have gained new credit for the story.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> This was Proculus Julius, who, when the people were distracted with the loss of their king and in no friendly mood towards the senate, being, as tradition tells, weighty in council, were the matter never so important, addressed the assembly as follows: <quote>Quirites, the Father of this City, Romulus, descended suddenly from the sky at dawn this morning and appeared to me. Covered with confusion, I stood reverently before him, praying that it might be vouchsafed me to look upon his face without sin.<note>The Romans regularly prayed with the head cloaked.</note>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/> \\'Go,\\' said he, \\'and declare to the Romans the will of Heaven that my Rome shall be the capital of the world; so let them cherish the art of war, and let them know and teach their children that no human strength can resist Roman arms.\\'\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"8\"/> So saying,</quote> he concluded, <quote>Romulus departed on high.</quote> It is wonderful what credence the people placed in that man\\'s tale, and how the grief for the loss of Romulus, which the plebeians <pb id=\"p.61\"/>and the army felt, was quieted by the assurance of<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 716</note> his immortality.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"chapter\" n=\"17\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>The senators meanwhile were engaged in a struggle for the coveted kingship. So far it had not come to a question of any one person, for nobody stood out with special prominence in the new nation; instead, a strife of factions was waging between the two stocks.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> Those of Sabine origin, having had no king on their side since the death of Tatius, feared that despite their equal rights they might lose their hold upon the sovereign power, and hence desired that the king should be chosen from their own body.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> The original Romans spurned the idea of an alien king. Various, however, as were men\\'s inclinations, to be ruled by a king was their universal wish, for they had not yet tasted the sweetness of liberty.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> Then the senators became alarmed, lest the state wanting a ruler and the army a leader, and many neighbouring states being disaffected, some violence might be offered from without.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> All therefore were agreed that there should be some head, but nobody could make up his mind to yield to his fellow. And so the hundred senators shared the power among themselves, establishing ten decuries and appointing one man for each decury to preside over the administration.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> Ten men exercised authority; only one had its insignia and lictors. Five days was the period of his power, which passed in rotation to all; and for a year the monarchy lapsed. This interval was called, as it was, an interregnum, a name which even yet obtains.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/> Murmurs then arose among the plebs that their servitude had been multiplied; that a hundred masters had been given them instead of <pb id=\"p.63\"/>one. No longer, it seemed, would they endure<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 716</note> anything short of a king, and a king, too, of their own choosing.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"8\"/> Perceiving that such ideas were in the wind, the senators thought it would be well to proffer spontaneously a thing which they were on the verge of losing, and obtained the favour of the people by granting them supreme power on such terms as to part with no greater prerogative than they retained.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"9\"/> For they decreed that when the people should have named a king, their act should only be valid in case the senators ratified it. Even now, in voting for laws and magistrates, the same right is exercised, but is robbed of its significance; before the people can begin to vote, and when the result of the election is undetermined, the Fathers ratify it.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"10\"/> On the present occasion the interrex summoned the assembly and spoke as follows: <quote>May prosperity, favour, and fortune attend our action! Quirites, choose your king. Such is the pleasure of the Fathers, who, in their turn, if your choice fall upon one worthy to be called Romulus\\' successor, will confirm your election.</quote>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"11\"/> This so pleased the plebs, that, unwilling to appear outdone in generosity, they merely resolved and ordered that the senate should decree who should be king in Rome.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"chapter\" n=\"18\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>A great reputation for justice and piety was enjoyed in those days by Numa Pompilius. Cures, a town of the Sabines, was his home, and he was deeply versed, so far as anyone could be in that age, in all law, divine and human.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> The teacher to whom he owed his learning was not, as men say, in default of another name, the Samian Pythagoras; for it is well established that Servius Tullius was king at Rome, more than a hundred years after this <pb id=\"p.65\"/>time, when Pythagoras gathered about him, on the<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 716</note> farthest coasts of Italy, in the neighbourhood of Metapontum, Heraclea, and Croton, young men eager to share his studies.<note>It was about <date value=\"-530\">530 B.C.</date> when Pythagoras settled in Croton.</note>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> And from that country, even if he had been contemporary, how could his fame have reached the Sabines? Again, in what common language could he have induced anyone to seek instruction of him? Or under whose protection could a solitary man have made his way through so many nations differing in speech and customs?\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> It was Numa\\'s native disposition, then, as I incline to believe, that tempered his soul with noble qualities, and his training was not in foreign studies, but in the stern and austere discipline of the ancient Sabines, a race incorruptible as any race of the olden time.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> When Numa\\'s name had been proposed, the Roman senators perceived that the Sabines would gain the ascendancy if a king were to be chosen from that nation; yet nobody ventured to urge his own claims in preference to those of such a man, nor the claim of any other of his faction, nor those, in short, of any of the senators or citizens.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> And so they unanimously voted to offer the sovereignty to Numa Pompilius. Being summoned to Rome he commanded that, just as Romulus had obeyed the augural omens in building his city and assuming regal power, so too in his own case the gods should be consulted. Accordingly an augur (who thereafter, as a mark of honour, was made a priest of the state in permanent charge of that function) conducted him to the citadel and caused him to sit down on a stone, facing the south.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/> The augur seated himself on Numa\\'s left, having his head covered, and holding his in right hand the crooked staff without a knot <pb id=\"p.67\"/>which they call a <hi rend=\"italics\">lituus.</hi>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"8\"/> Then, looking out over the<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 716</note> City and the country beyond, he prayed to the gods, and marked off the heavens by a line from east to west, designating as \\' right\\' the regions to the south, as \\'left\\' those to the north, and fixing in his mind a landmark opposite to him and as far away as the eye could reach;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"9\"/> next shifting the crook to his left hand and, laying his right hand on Numa\\'s head, he uttered the following prayer: <quote>Father Jupiter, if it is Heaven\\'s will that this man Numa Pompilius, whose head I am touching, be king in Rome, do thou exhibit to us unmistakable signs within those limits which I have set.</quote>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"10\"/> He then specified the auspices which he desired should be sent, and upon their appearance Numa was declared king, and so descended from the augural station.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"chapter\" n=\"19\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>When he had thus obtained the kingship, he<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 715-672</note> prepared to give the new City, founded by force of arms, a new foundation in law, statutes, and observances.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> And perceiving that men could not grow used to these things in the midst of wars, since their natures grew wild and savage through warfare, he thought it needful that his warlike people should be softened by the disuse of arms, and built the temple of Janus at the bottom of the Argiletum, as an index of peace and war, that when open it might signify that the nation was in arms, when closed that all the peoples round about were pacified.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> Twice since Numa\\'s reign has it been closed: once in the consulship of Titus Manlius, after the conclusion of the First Punic War; the second time, which the gods permitted our own generation to witness, was after the battle of Actium, when the emperor Caesar Augustus had brought about peace on land and <pb id=\"p.69\"/>sea.<note>This was evidently written before <date value=\"-25\">25 B.C.</date>, when the temple was again closed by Augustus. But it was not written before 27, for it was not until that year that the title of Augustus was conferred upon the emperor. We thus arrive at an approximate date for the beginning of Livy\\'s history.</note>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> Numa closed the temple after first securing the<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 715-672</note> good will of all the neighbouring tribes by alliances and treaties. And fearing lest relief from anxiety on the score of foreign perils might lead men who had hitherto been held back by fear of their enemies and by military discipline into extravagance and idleness, he thought the very first thing to do, as being the most efficacious with a populace which was ignorant and, in those early days, uncivilized, was to imbue them with the fear of Heaven.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> As he could not instil this into their hearts without inventing some marvellous story, he pretended to have nocturnal meetings with the goddess Egeria, and that hers was the advice which guided him in the establishment of rites most approved by the gods, and in the appointment of special priests for the service of each.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p><milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/>And first of all he divided the year into twelve months, according to the revolutions of the moon. But since the moon does not give months of quite thirty days each, and eleven days are wanting to the full complement of a year as marked by the sun\\'s revolution, he inserted intercalary months in such a way that in the twentieth year the days should fall in with the same position of the sun from which they had started, and the period of twenty years be rounded out.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/> He also appointed days when public business might not be carried on, and others when it might, since it would sometimes be desirable that nothing should be brought before the people.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> <pb id=\"p.71\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"chapter\" n=\"20\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>He then turned his attention to the<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 715-672</note> appointment of priests, although lie performed very many priestly duties himself, especially those which now belong to the Flamen Dialis.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> But inasmuch as he thought that in a warlike nation there would be more kings like Romulus than like Numa, and that they would take the field in person, he did not wish the sacrificial duties of the kingly office to be neglected, and so appointed a flamen for Jupiter, as his perpetual priest, and provided him with a conspicuous dress and the royal curule chair. To him he added two other flamens, one for Mars, the other for Quirinus.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> In like manner he designated virgins for Vesta\\'s service &mdash;a priesthood, this, that derived from Alba and so was not unsuited to the founder\\'s stock. That they might be perpetual priestesses of the temple, he assigned them a stipend from the public treasury, and by the rule of virginity and other observances invested them with awe and sanctity.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> He likewise chose twelve Salii for Mars Gradivus, and granted them the distinction of wearing the embroidered tunic and over it a bronze breastplate, and of bearing the divine shields which men call <hi rend=\"italics\">ancilia,</hi><note>The original <hi rend=\"italics\">ancile</hi> was a shield fabled to have fallen from heaven. To lessen the chance of its being stolen, eleven others were .made exactly like it. It was of a peculiar shape, something like a violin. See Fowler, <hi rend=\"italics\">Fest.</hi> p.42.</note> while they proceeded through the City, chanting their hymns to the triple beat of their solemn dance.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> He next chose as pontifex Numa Marcius, son of Marcus, one of the senators, and to him he intrusted written directions, full and accurate, for performing the rites of worship; with what victims, on what days, in what temple, sacrifices should be offered, and from what sources money was to be disbursed to pay their costs.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> All other public and private sacrifices lie likewise made subject to the decrees of the pontifex, that there <pb id=\"p.73\"/>might be someone to whom the commons could<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 715-672</note> come for advice, lest any confusion should arise in the religious law through the neglect of ancestral rites and the adoption of strange ones.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/> And not merely ceremonies relating to the gods above, but also proper funeral observances and the propitiation of the spirits of the dead were to be taught by the pontifex as well, and also what prodigies manifested by lightning or other visible sign were to be taken in hand and averted. With the purpose of eliciting this knowledge from the minds of the gods, Numa dedicated an altar on the Aventine to Jupiter Elicius, and consulted the god by augury, that he might learn what portents were to be regarded.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"chapter\" n=\"21\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>The consideration and disposal of these matters diverted the thoughts of the whole people from violence and arms. Not only had they something to occupy their minds, but their constant preoccupation with the gods, now that it seemed to them that concern for human affairs was felt by the heavenly powers, had so tinged the hearts of all with piety, that the nation was governed by its regard for promises and oaths, rather than by the dread of laws and penalties.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> And while Numa\\'s subjects were spontaneously imitating the character of their king, as their unique exemplar, the neighboring peoples also, who had hitherto considered that it was no city but a camp that had been set up in their midst, as a menace to the general peace, came to feel such reverence for them, that they thought it sacrilege to injure a nation so wholly bent upon the worship of the gods.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> There was a grove watered by a perennial spring which flowed through the midst of it, out of a dark cave. Thither <pb id=\"p.75\"/>Numa would often withdraw, without witnesses, as<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 715-672</note> if to meet the goddess; so he dedicated the grove to the Camenae, alleging that they held counsel there with his wife Egeria.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> He also established an annual worship of Faith, to whose chapel he ordered that the flamens should proceed in a two-horse hooded carriage, and should wrap up their arms as far as the fingers before sacrificing, as a sign that faith must be kept, and that even in men\\'s clasped hands her seat is sacred.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> He established many other rites, as well as places of sacrifice, which the pontiffs called <hi rend=\"italics\">Argei.</hi><note>There were six of these shrines or chapels in each of the four regions of the Servian city. A procession made the round of the <hi rend=\"italics\">Argei</hi> on March 17; and on May 15 rush puppets, also called <hi rend=\"italics\">Argei,</hi> and probably corresponding to the shrines in number, were thrown into the Tiber by the Vestal Virgins, in the presence of the priestess of Jupiter, who was dressed in mourning. The meaning of both ceremonies is obscure. See Fowler, <hi rend=\"italics\">Fest.</hi> pp. 54 and 111.</note> But of all his services the greatest was this, that throughout his reign he guarded peace no less jealously than his kingdom.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> Thus two successive kings in different ways, one by war, the other by peace, promoted the nation\\'s welfare. Romulus ruled thirty-seven years, Numa forty-three. The state was not only strong, but was also well organized in the arts both of war and of peace.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"chapter\" n=\"22\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>At Numa\\'s death the state reverted to an<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 672-640</note> interregnum. Then Tullus Hostilius, grandson of that Hostilius who had distinguished himself in the battle with the Sabines at the foot of the citadel, was declared king by the people, and the senate confirmed their choice.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> This monarch was not only unlike the last, but was actually more warlike than Romulus had been. Besides his youth and strength, the glory of his grandfather was also an incentive to him. So, thinking that the nation was growing decrepit from inaction, he everywhere sought excuses for stirring up war.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> It happened that the Roman rustics were <pb id=\"p.77\"/>driving off cattle from Alban territory, while the<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 672-640</note> Albans were treating the Romans in the same way. The man who was then in power in Alba was Gaius Cluilius.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> Each side, at about the same time, sent envoys to demand restitution. Tullus had commanded his envoys to do nothing else till they had carried out his orders; he felt convinced that the Albans would refuse his demands, in which case he could declare war with a good conscience. The Alban representatives proceeded rather laxly.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> Received by Tullus with gracious and kindly hospitality, they attended in a friendly spirit the banquet which he gave in their honour. Meanwhile the Romans had been beforehand with them in seeking redress, and, being denied it by the Alban leader, had made a declaration of war, to take effect in thirty days.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> Returning, they reported these things to Tullus, who thereupon invited the Alban envoys to inform him of the object of their mission. They, knowing nothing of what had happened, at first spent some time in apologies. They said they should be sorry to utter anything which might give offence to Tullus, but that they were compelled to do so by their orders; they had come to seek restitution; if it should be denied them they were commanded to declare war.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/> To this Tullus replied: <quote>Tell your king the Roman king calls the gods to witness which people first spurned the other\\'s demand for redress and dismissed its envoys, that they may call down upon the guilty nation all the disasters of this war.</quote>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"chapter\" n=\"23\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>With this answer the Albans returned to their city, and both sides prepared for war with the greatest energy &mdash;a civil war, to all intents and purposes, almost as if fathers were arrayed against sons; <pb id=\"p.79\"/>for both were of Trojan ancestry, since Lavinium had<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 672-640</note> been planted from Troy, Alba from Lavinium, and from the line of the Alban kings had come the Romans.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> Still, the issue of the war made the struggle less deplorable, for no battle was fought, and when only the buildings of one of the cities had been destroyed, the two peoples were fused into one.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> The Albans were first in the field, and with a great army invaded the Roman territory. Their camp they pitched not more than five miles from the City, and surrounded it with a trench. (This was known for some centuries as the Cluilian Trench, from the name of the general, until in the course of time both trench and name disappeared.)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> In this camp Cluilius the Alban king died, and the Albans chose as dictator Mettius Fufetius. Meantime Tullus, emboldened principally by the death of the king, and asserting that Heaven\\'s great powers would take vengeance upon all of the Alban name, beginning with their king himself, for their unscrupulous war, made a night march past the enemy\\'s camp and led his army into the country of the Albans. This move drew Mettius out from his fortifications.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> Leading his troops the shortest way towards the enemy, he sent an envoy on ahead to say to Tullus that before they fought it was well that they should confer together; if Tullus would meet him he was confident he had that to say which would be of no less moment to the Roman state than to the Alban. Without rejecting this suggestion, Tullus nevertheless drew up his men in line of battle, in case the proposals should prove impracticable.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> On the other side the Albans also formed up. When both armies had been marshalled, the leaders, <pb id=\"p.81\"/>attended by a few of their nobles, advanced to<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 672-640</note> the middle of the field.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/> Then the Alban began as follows:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p><quote>Pillage and failure to make the amends demanded in accordance with our treaty I think I have myself heard named by our king, Cluilius, as the occasion of this war, and I doubt not, Tullus, but you make the same contention. But if truth is to be spoken, rather than sophistries, it is greed for dominion that is goading two kindred and neighbouring peoples into war.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"8\"/> Whether rightly or wrongly I do not attempt to determine; that is a question that may well have been considered by him who undertook the war; I am only the general appointed by the Albans to prosecute that war. But this is the point, Tullus, which I wish to suggest to you: Of the magnitude of the Etruscan power which encompasses us, and you especially, you are better aware than we, in proportion as you are nearer to that people. Great is their strength on land, exceedingly great on the sea.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"9\"/> You must consider that the instant you give the signal for battle, the Tuscans will be watching our two armies, so that, when we have become tired and exhausted, they may attack at once the victor and the vanquished. In Heaven\\'s name, therefore, since we are not content with unquestioned liberty, but are proceeding to the doubtful hazard of dominion or enslavement, let us adopt some plan by which we may decide the question which nation shall rule the other, without a great disaster and much carnage on both sides.</quote>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p><milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"10\"/>Tullus made no objection, though inclined to war by nature no less than by his anticipation of victory. While both parties were considering what to do, a plan was hit upon for the execution of which Fortune herself supplied the means.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> <pb id=\"p.83\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"chapter\" n=\"24\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>It chanced that there were in each of<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 672-640</note> these armies triplet brothers, not ill-matched either in age or in physical prowess. That they were Horatii and Curiatii is generally allowed, and scarcely any other ancient tradition is better known; yet, in spite of the celebrity of the affair, an uncertainty persists in regard to the names &mdash;to which people, that is, the Horatii belonged, and to which the Curiatii. The writers of history are divided. Still, the majority, I find, call the Roman brothers Horatii, and theirs is the opinion I incline to adopt.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> To these young men the kings proposed a combat in which each should fight for his own city, the dominion to belong with that side where the victory should rest.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> No objection was raised, and time and place were agreed on. Before proceeding with the battle, a treaty was made between the Romans and the Albans, providing that the nation whose citizens should triumph in this contest should hold undisputed sway over the other nation. One treaty differs from another in its terms, but the same procedure is always employed.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> On the present occasion we are told that they did as follows, nor has tradition preserved the memory of any more ancient compact. The fetial<note>The <hi rend=\"italics\">fetiales</hi> (related to <hi rend=\"italics\">facio,</hi> <quote>do</quote>) were a college of priests whose duties were to represent the state in declaring war, making peace, entering into treaties, etc. <hi rend=\"italics\">The pater</hi> <hi rend=\"italics\">patratus</hi> (from <hi rend=\"italics\">patro,</hi> <quote>accomplish</quote> or <quote>bring about</quote>) was the spokesman of the deputation.</note> asked King Tullus, <quote>Dost thou command me, King, to make a treaty with the <hi rend=\"italics\">pater patratus</hi> of the Alban People?</quote> Being so commanded by the king, he said, <quote>I demand of thee, King, the sacred herb.</quote>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> The king replied, <quote>Thou shalt take it untainted.</quote> The fetial brought from the citadel an untainted plant. After this he asked the king, <quote>Dost thou grant me, King, with my emblems and my companions, the royal sanction, to <pb id=\"p.85\"/>speak for the Roman People of the Quirites?</quote>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> The<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 672-640</note> king made answer, <quote>So far as may be without prejudice to myself and the Roman People of the Quirites, I grant it.</quote> The fetial was Marcus Valerius; he made Spurius Fusius <hi rend=\"italics\">pater patratus,</hi> touching his head and hair with the sacred sprig. The <hi rend=\"italics\">pater patratus</hi> is appointed to pronounce the oath, that is, to solemnize the pact; and this he accomplishes with many words, expressed in a long metrical formula which it is not worth while to quote.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/> The conditions being then recited, he cries, <quote>Hear, Jupiter; hear, <hi rend=\"italics\">pater patratus</hi> of the Alban People: hear ye, People of Alba: From these terms, as they have been publicly rehearsed from beginning to end, without fraud, from these tablets, or this wax, and as they have been this day clearly understood, the Roman People will not be the first to depart.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"8\"/> If it shall first depart from them, by general consent, with malice aforethought, then on that day do thou, great Diespiter, so smite the Roman People as I shall here to-day smite this pig: and so much the harder smite them as thy power and thy strength are greater.</quote>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"9\"/> When Spurius had said these words, he struck the pig with a flint. In like manner the Albans pronounced their own forms and their own oath, by the mouth of their own dictator and priests.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"chapter\" n=\"25\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>When the treaty had been established, the brothers armed themselves, in accordance with the agreement. On either side the soldiers urged on their champions. They reminded them that their fathers\\' gods, their native land, their parents, and all their countrymen, whether at home or with the army, had their eye only on their swords and their right hands.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> Eager for the combat, as well owing to their <pb id=\"p.87\"/>native spirit as to the shouts of encouragement which<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 672-640</note> filled their ears, the brothers advanced into the space between the two lines of battle. The two armies were drawn up, each in front of its own camp, no longer in any immediate danger, but their concern as great as ever; and no wonder, since empire was staked on those few men\\'s valour and good fortune!\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> Alert, therefore, and in suspense, they concentrated their attention upon this unpleasing spectacle. The signal was given, and with drawn steel, like advancing battle-lines, the six young men rushed to the charge, breathing the courage of great armies. Neither side thought of its own danger, but of the nation\\'s sovereignty or servitude, and how from that day forward their country must experience the fortune they should themselves create.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> The instant they encountered, there was a clash of shields and a flash of glittering blades, while a deep shudder ran through the onlookers, who, as long as neither side had the advantage, remained powerless to speak or breathe.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> Then, in the hand-to-hand fight which followed, wherein were soon exhibited to men\\'s eyes not only struggling bodies and the play of the sword and shield, but also bloody wounds, two of the Romans fell, fatally wounded, one upon the other, while all three of the Albans were wounded.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> At the fall of the Romans a shout of joy burst from the Alban army, while the Roman levies now bade farewell to all their hopes; but not to their anxiety, for they were horror-stricken at the plight of the single warrior whom the three Curiatii had surrounded.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/> He happened to have got no hurt, and though no match for his enemies together, was ready to fight them one at a time. So, to divide their attack, he <pb id=\"p.89\"/>fled, thinking that each of them would pursue him<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 672-640</note> with what speed his wounds permitted.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"8\"/> He had already run some little distance from the spot where they had fought, when, looking back, he saw that they were following at wide intervals and that one of them had nearly overtaken him.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"9\"/> Facing about, he ran swiftly up to his man, and while the Alban host were calling out to the Curiatii to help their brother, Horatius had already slain him, and was hastening, flushed with victory, to meet his second antagonist. Then with a cheer, such as is often drawn from partisans by a sudden turn in a contest, the Romans encouraged their champion, and he pressed on to end the battle.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"10\"/> And so, before the third Curiatius could come up &mdash;and he was not far off &mdash;Horatius dispatched the second.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"11\"/> They were now on even terns, one soldier surviving on each side, but in hope and vigour they were far from equal. The one, unscathed and elated by his double victory, was eager for a third encounter. The other dragged himself along, faint from his wound and exhausted with running; he thought how his brothers had been slaughtered before him, and was a beaten man when he faced his triumphant foe. What followed was no combat.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"12\"/> The Roman cried exultantly, <quote>Two victims I have given to the shades of my brothers: the third I will offer up to the cause of this war, that Roman may rule Alban.</quote> His adversary could barely hold up his shield.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"13\"/> With a downward thrust Horatius buried his sword in the Alban\\'s throat, and despoiled him where he lay. The Romans welcomed their hero with jubilations and thanksgivings, and their joy was all the greater that they had come near despairing. The burial of their dead then claimed the attention <pb id=\"p.91\"/>of the two armies, &mdash;with widely different feelings,<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 672-640</note> since one nation was exalted with imperial power, the other made subject to a foreign sway.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"14\"/> The graves may still be seen where each soldier fell: two Roman graves in one spot, nearer Alba; those of the three Albans towards Rome, but separated, just as they had fought.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"chapter\" n=\"26\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>Before they left the field Mettius asked, in pursuance of the compact, what Tullus commanded him to do, and the Roman ordered him to hold his young men under arms, saying that he should employ their services, if war broke out with the Veientes.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> The armies then marched home. In the van of the Romans came Horatius, displaying his triple spoils. As he drew near the Porta Capena he was met by his unwedded sister, who had been promised in marriage to one of the Curiatii. When she recognized on her brother\\'s shoulders the military cloak of her betrothed, which she herself had woven, she loosed her hair and, weeping, called on her dead lover\\'s name.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> It enraged the fiery youth to hear his sister\\'s lamentations in the hour of his own victory and the nation\\'s great rejoicing. And so, drawing his sword and at the same time angrily upbraiding her, he ran her through the body.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> <quote>Begone</quote> he cried, <quote>to your betrothed, with your ill-timed love, since you have forgot your brothers, both the dead and the living, and forgot your country!\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> So perish every Roman woman who mourns a foe!</quote>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Horrid as this deed seemed to the Fathers and the people, his recent service was an off-set to it; nevertheless he was seized and brought before the king for trial. The king, that he might not take upon himself the responsibility for so stern and unpopular a judgement, and for the punishment which must follow <pb id=\"p.93\"/>sentence, called together the council of the people<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 672-640</note> and said: <quote>In accordance with the law I appoint duumvirs to pass judgement upon Horatius for treason.</quote><note>By taking it upon himself to punish his sister, Horatius had usurped a function of the state, and so was guilty of treason.</note>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> The dread formula of the law ran thus: <quote>Let the duumvirs pronounce him guilty of treason; if he shall appeal from the duumvirs, let the appeal be tried; if the duumvirs win, let the lictor veil his head; let him bind him with a rope to a barren tree; let him scourge him either within or without the pomerium.</quote><note>I have adopted the view of Oldfather (<hi rend=\"italics\">T.A.P.A.</hi> xxxix. pp. 49 ff.) that neither hanging nor crucifixion is meant, but that the culprit was fastened to the tree and scourged to death.</note>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/> By the terms of this law duumvirs were appointed. They considered that they might not acquit, under that act, even one who was innocent, and having given a verdict of guilty, one of them pronounced the words, <quote>Publius Horatius, I adjudge you a traitor; go, lictor, bind his hands.</quote>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"8\"/> The lictor had approached and was about to fit the noose. Then Horatius, at the prompting of Tullus, who put a merciful construction upon the law, cried, <quote>I appeal!</quote>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"9\"/> And so the appeal was tried before the people. What influenced men most of all in that trial was the assertion of Publius Horatius, the father, that his daughter had been justly slain; otherwise he should have used a father\\'s authority and have punished his son, himself. He then implored them not to make him childless whom they had beheld a little while before surrounded by a goodly offspring.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"10\"/> So saying, the old man embraced the youth, and pointing to the spoils of the Curiatii set up in the place which is now called <quote>the Horatian Spears,</quote><note>The name of the place which commemorated the spoils reflects the tradition, rejected above by Livy, that the Horatii were Albans, the Curiatii Romans.</note> he exclaimed, <quote>This man you saw but lately advancing <pb id=\"p.95\"/>decked with spoils and triumphing in his victory;<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 672-640</note> can you bear, Quirites, to see him bound beneath a fork and scourged and tortured? Hardly could Alban eyes endure so hideous a sight.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"11\"/> Go, lictor, bind the hands which but now, with sword and shield, brought imperial power to the Roman People! Go, veil the head of the liberator of this city! Bind him to a barren tree! Scourge him within the pomerium, if you will &mdash;so it be amidst yonder spears and trophies of our enemies &mdash;or outside the pomerium &mdash;so it be amongst the graves of the Curiatii! For whither can you lead this youth where his own honours will not vindicate him from so foul a punishment?</quote>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"12\"/> The people could not withstand the father\\'s tears, or the courage of Horatius himself, steadfast in every peril; and they acquitted him, more in admiration of his valour than from the justice of his cause. And so, that the flagrant murder might yet be cleansed away, by some kind of expiatory rite, the father was commanded to make atonement for his son at the public cost.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"13\"/> He therefore offered certain piacular sacrifices, which were thenceforward handed down in the Horatian family, and, erecting a beam across the street, to typify a yoke, he made his son pass under it, with covered head. It remains to this day, being restored from time to time at the state\\'s expense, and is known as <quote>the Sister\\'s Beam.</quote>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"14\"/> Horatia\\'s tomb, of hewn stone, was built on the place where she had been struck down.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"chapter\" n=\"27\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>But the peace with Alba did not last long. The discontent of the people, who criticized the dictator for having confided the nation\\'s welfare to three soldiers, broke down his weak character, and since honest measures had proved unsuccessful, <pb id=\"p.97\"/>he resorted to evil ones to regain the favour of his<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 672-640</note> countrymen.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> Accordingly, just as in war he had sought peace, so now in time of peace he desired war. But seeing that his own state was richer in courage than in strength, he stirred up other tribes to make war openly after due declaration; while for his own people he reserved the part of the traitor under the disguise of friendship.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> The men of Fidenae, a Roman colony, and the Veientes, whom they admitted to a share in their designs, were induced to commence hostilities by a promise that the Albans would go over to their side.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> Fidenae having openly revolted, Tullus summoned Mettius and his army from Alba, and led his forces against the enemy. Crossing the Anio, he pitched his camp at the confluence of the rivers. The Veientine army had crossed the Tiber between that place and Fidenae.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> These troops, drawn up next the river, formed the right wing; on the left the Fidenates were posted, nearer the mountains. Tullus marshalled his own men against the Veientine enemy; the Albans he posted opposite the army of Fidenae. The Alban commander was as wanting in courage as in loyalty. Not daring, therefore, either to hold his ground or openly to desert, he drew off by imperceptible degrees in the direction of the mountains.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> Then, when he thought he had got near enough to them, he brought up his whole battle-line to an elevated position, and still irresolute, deployed his ranks with the object of consuming time. His purpose was to swing his forces to the side which fortune favoured.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/> At first the Romans posted next to the Albans were amazed when they perceived that their flank was being uncovered by the withdrawal of their allies; then a <pb id=\"p.99\"/>horseman galloped up to the king, and told him that<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 672-640</note> the Albans were marching off. In this crisis Tullus vowed to establish twelve Salian priests,<note>These were the so-called <hi rend=\"italics\">Collini,</hi> or <hi rend=\"italics\">Agonales,</hi> and were associated with Quirinus, as the <hi rend=\"italics\">Palatini</hi> (chap. xx.) were with Mars Gradivus. See also v. lii. 7.</note> and to build shrines to Pallor and Panic.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"8\"/> The horseman he reprimanded in a loud voice, that the enemy might overhear him, and ordered him to go back and fight; there was no occasion for alarm; it was by his own command that the Alban army was marching round, that they might attack the unprotected rear of the Fidenates.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"9\"/> He also ordered the cavalry to raise their spears. This man&oelig;uvre hid the retreat of the Alban army from a large part of the Roman foot-soldiers; those who had seen it, believing what the king had been heard to say, fought all the more impetuously. The enemy in their turn now became alarmed; they had heard Tullus\\'s loud assertion, and many of the Fidenates, having had Romans among them as colonists, knew Latin.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"10\"/> And so, lest the Albans should suddenly charge down from the hills and cut them off from their town, they beat a retreat. Tullus pressed them hard, and having routed the wing composed of the Fidenates, returned, bolder than ever, to the Veientes, who were demoralized by the panic of their neighbours.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"11\"/> They, too, failed to withstand his attack, but their rout was stopped by the river in their rear When they had fled thus far, some basely threw away their arms and rushed blindly into the water, others hesitated on the bank and were overtaken before they had made up their minds whether to flee or resist. Never before had the Romans fought a bloodier battle.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> <pb id=\"p.101\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"chapter\" n=\"28\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>Then the Alban army, which had been a<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 672-640</note> spectator of the battle, was led down into the plain. Mettius congratulated Tullus on the conquest of his enemies; Tullus replied kindly to Mettius, and commanded the Albans in a good hour to join their camp to that of the Romans.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> He then made preparations to perform, on the morrow, a sacrifice of purification. At dawn, when all things were in readiness, he issued to both armies the customary order, convoking them to an assembly.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> The heralds, beginning at the outskirts of the camp, called out the Albans first, who being moved by the very novelty of the occasion, took their stand close to the Roman king, that they might hear him harangue his army.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> The Roman troops, by previous arrangement, were armed and disposed around them, and the centurions were bidden to execute orders promptly. Then Tullus began as follows:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p><quote>Romans, if ever anywhere in any war you have had reason to give thanks, first to the immortal gods and then to your own valour, it was in the battle of yesterday. For you fought not only against your enemies, but a harder and more dangerous fight &mdash;against the treachery and the perfidy of your allies.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> For, to undeceive you, I gave no orders that the Albans should draw off towards the mountains. What you heard was not my command, but a trick and a pretended command, devised in order that you might not know you were being deserted, and so be distracted from the fight; and that the enemy, thinking that they were being hemmed in on the rear, might be panic-stricken and flee.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> And yet this guilt which I am charging does not attach to all the Albans; they but followed <pb id=\"p.103\"/>their general, as you, too, would have done, had I<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 672-640</note> desired to lead you off anywhere. It is Mettius yonder who led this march; Mettius, too, who contrived this war; Mettius who broke the treaty between Roman and Alban.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/> Let another dare such a deed hereafter if I do not speedily visit such a punishment on him as shall be a conspicuous warning to all mankind.</quote>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Thereupon the centurions, sword in hand, surrounded Mettius, while the king proceeded: <quote>May prosperity, favour, and fortune be with the Roman people and myself, and with you, men of Alba! I purpose to bring all the Alban people over to Rome, to grant citizenship to their commons, to enroll the nobles in the senate, to make one city and one state. As formerly from one people the Alban nation was divided into two, so now let it be reunited into one.</quote>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"8\"/> Hearing these words the Alban soldiers, themselves unarmed and fenced in by armed men, were constrained, however their wishes might differ, by a common fear, and held their peace.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"9\"/> Then Tullus said: <quote>Mettius Fufetius, if you were capable of learning, yourself, to keep faith and abide by treaties, you should have lived that I might teach you this; as it is, since your disposition is incurable, you shall yet by your punishment teach the human race to hold sacred the obligations you have violated.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"10\"/> Accordingly, just as a little while ago your heart was divided between the states of Fidenae and Rome, so now you shall give up your body to be torn two ways,</quote> He then brought up two four-horse chariots, and caused Mettius to be stretched out and made fast to them, after which the horses were whipped up in opposite directions, and bore off in <pb id=\"p.105\"/>each of the cars fragments of the mangled body,<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 672-640</note> where the limbs held to their fastenings.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"11\"/> All eyes were turned away from so dreadful a sight. Such was the first and last punishment among the Romans of a kind that disregards the laws of humanity. In other cases we may boast that with no nation have milder punishments found favour.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"chapter\" n=\"29\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>While this was going on, horsemen had already been sent on to Alba to fetch the inhabitants to Rome, and afterwards the legions were marched over to demolish the city.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> When they entered the gates there was not, indeed, the tumult and panic which usually follow the capture of a city, when its gates have been forced or its walls breached with a ram or its stronghold stormed, when the shouts of the enemy and the rush of armed men through the streets throw the whole town into a wild confusion of blood and fire.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> But at Alba oppressive silence and grief that found no words quite overwhelmed the spirits of all the people; too dismayed to think what they should take with them and what leave behind, they would ask each other\\'s advice again and again, now standing on their thresholds, and now roaming aimlessly through the houses they were to look upon for that last time.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> But when at length the horsemen began to be urgent, and clamorously commanded them to come out; when they could now hear the crash of the buildings which were being pulled down in the outskirts of the city; when the dust rising in different quarters had overcast the sky like a gathering cloud; then everybody made haste to carry out what he could, and forth they went, abandoning their lares and penates,<note>Each family had its <hi rend=\"italics\">lar,</hi> a special deity who protected the household, and its <hi rend=\"italics\">penates,</hi> guardians of the <hi rend=\"italics\">penus</hi> (the family store of provisions).</note> and the houses where they had been born and brought up.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> And now the streets were filled with an unbroken <pb id=\"p.107\"/>procession of emigrants, whose mutual pity, as they<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 672-640</note> gazed at one another, caused their tears to start afresh; plaintive cries too began to be heard, proceeding chiefly from the women, when they passed the venerable temples beset by armed men, and left in captivity, as it seemed to them, their gods.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> When the Albans had quitted the city, the Romans everywhere levelled with the ground all buildings, both public and private, and a single hour gave over to destruction and desolation the work of the four hundred years during which Alba had stood. But the temples of the gods were spared, for so the king had decreed.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"chapter\" n=\"30\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>Rome, meanwhile, was increased by Alba\\'s downfall. The number of citizens was doubled, the Caelian Hill was added to the City, and, that it might be more thickly settled, Tullus chose it for the site of the king\\'s house and from that time onwards resided there.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> The chief men of the Albans he made senators, that this branch of the nation might grow too. Such were the Julii, the Servilii, the Quinctii, the Geganii, the Curiatii, and the Cloelii. He also built, as a consecrated place for the order he had enlarged, a senate-house, which continued to be called the Curia Hostilia as late as the time of our own fathers.<note>When Clodius was murdered, in <date value=\"-52\">52 B.C.</date>, the mob burnt his body in the Curia Hostilia, which caught fire and was destroyed.</note>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> And that all the orders might gain some strength from the new people, he enrolled ten squadrons of knights<note>Each squadron contained thirty men. The total number was, therefore, the same as that of the three centuries of Romulus.</note> from among the Albans, and from the same source filled up the old legions and enlisted new ones.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p><milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/>Confiding in these forces, Tullus declared war on <pb id=\"p.109\"/>the Sabines, a nation second only at that time to<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 672-640</note> the Etruscans in its wealth of men and arms. On either side there had been aggressions and refusals to grant satisfaction.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> Tullus complained that at the shrine of Feronia, in a crowded fair, Roman traders had been seized; the Sabines alleged that, before this, refugees from their country had fled to the grove of sanctuary, and had been detained in Rome.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> These were put forward as the causes of war. The Sabines, not forgetting that a portion of their own forces had been settled in Rome by Tatius and that the Roman state had recently been further strengthened by the addition of the Alban people, began themselves to look about for outside help.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/> Etruria was close by, and the nearest of the Etruscans were the Veientes. There the resentment left over from the wars was the strongest incentive to revolt, and procured them some volunteers; while with certain vagrant and poverty-stricken plebeians even the prospect of pay was effectual. Official aid there was none, and the Veientes (for there is less to surprise us in the others) held firmly to the truce they had agreed upon with Romulus.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"8\"/> While preparations for war were making on both sides with the greatest energy, and success appeared to hinge upon which should first take the field, Tullus anticipated his enemies and invaded the Sabine country.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"9\"/> A desperate battle was fought near the Silva Malitiosa,<note><hi rend=\"italics\">i.e.</hi> <quote>Guileful Wood.</quote></note> where, owing partly, it is true, to the strength of their infantry, but most of all to their newly augmented cavalry, the Roman army gained the mastery.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"10\"/> The cavalry made a sudden charge; the ranks of the Sabines were thrown into disorder, and from that moment were unable, without heavy loss, either to hold their own in the fight or to extricate themselves by a retreat.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> <pb id=\"p.111\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"chapter\" n=\"31\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>After the defeat of the Sabines, when<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 672-640</note> King Tullus and the entire Roman state were at a high pitch of glory and prosperity, it was reported to the king and senators that there had been a rain of stones on the Alban Mount.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> As this could scarce be credited, envoys were dispatched to examine the prodigy, and in their sight there fell from the sky, like hail-stones which the wind piles in drifts upon the ground, a shower of pebbles.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> They thought too that they heard a mighty voice issuing from the grove on the mountain-top, which commanded the Albans to celebrate, according to the fashion of their fathers, the sacrifices, which as though they had forsaken their gods along with their city, they had given over to oblivion, either adopting Roman rites, or in anger at their fortune, such as men sometimes feel, abandoning the worship of the gods.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> The Romans also, in consequence of the same portent, undertook an official nine days\\' celebration, whether so commanded by the divine utterance from the Alban Mount &mdash;for this too is handed down &mdash;or on the advice of soothsayers.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> At all events it remained a regular custom that whenever the same prodigy was reported there should be a nine days\\' observance.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Not very long after this Rome was afflicted with a pestilence. This caused a reluctance to bear arms, yet no respite from service was allowed by the warlike king (who believed, besides, that the young men were healthier in the field than at home) until he himself contracted a lingering illness.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> Then that haughty spirit was so broken, with the breaking of his health, that he who had hitherto thought nothing less worthy of a king than to devote his mind to sacred rites, suddenly became a prey to all sorts of <pb id=\"p.113\"/>superstitions great and small, and filled even the<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 672-640</note> minds of the people with religious scruples.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/> Men were now agreed in wishing to recall the conditions which had obtained under King Numa, believing that the only remedy left for their ailing bodies was to procure peace and forgiveness from the gods.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"8\"/> The king himself, so tradition tells, in turning over the commentaries of Numa discovered there certain occult sacrifices performed in honour of Jupiter Elicius, and devoted himself in secret to those rites; but the ceremony was improperly undertaken or performed, and not only was no divine manifestation vouchsafed him, but in consequence of the wrath of Jupiter, who was provoked by his faulty observance, he was struck by a thunderbolt and consumed in the flames of his house. Tullus was greatly renowned in war and reigned thirty-two years.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"chapter\" n=\"32\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>On the death of Tullus, the government<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 640-616</note> reverted, in accordance with the custom established in the beginning, to the senators, who named an interrex. This official called together the comitia, and the people elected Ancus Marcius king, a choice which the Fathers ratified. Ancus Marcius was a grandson, on the mother\\'s side, of King Numa Pompilius.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> When he began to rule he was mindful of his grandfather\\'s glory, and considered that the last reign, excellent in all else, had failed to prosper in one respect, owing to neglect or misconduct of religious observances. Deeming it therefore a matter of the utmost consequence to perform the state sacrifices as Numa had established them, he bade the pontifex copy out all these from the commentaries of the king and display them in public on a whitened table. This act led the citizens, who were eager for peace, <pb id=\"p.115\"/>and also the neighbouring nations, to hope that he<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 640-616</note> would adopt the character and institutions of his grandfather.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> Hence the Latins, with whom a treaty had been made in the time of Tullus, plucked up courage, and raided Roman territory, and when called on by the Romans to make restitution, returned an arrogant answer, persuaded that the Roman king would spend his reign in inactivity amid shrines and altars. But the character of Ancus was well balanced, and he honoured the memory of Romulus, as well as Numa.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> And besides having a conviction that peace had been more necessary to his grandfather\\'s reign, when the nation had been both young and mettlesome, he also believed that the tranquillity, so free of attack, which had fallen to the lot of Numa would be no easy thing for himself to compass; his patience was being tried, and when proved would be regarded with contempt, and in short the times were better suited to the rule of a Tullus than a Numa.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> In order however that, as Numa had instituted religious practices in time of peace, he might himself give out a ceremonial of war, and that wars might not only be waged but also declared with some sort of formality, he copied from the ancient tribe of the Aequicoli the law, which the fetials now have,<note>The institution of the fetials was ascribed in chap. xxiv. to Tullus (so also Cic. <hi rend=\"italics\">Rep.</hi> ii. 31). Livy is here following another authority, without taking the trouble to remove the discrepancy. Other writers (Dion. ii. 72; Plut. <hi rend=\"italics\">Numa</hi> xii.) credit Numa with the institution.</note> by which redress is demanded.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p><milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/>When the envoy has arrived at the frontiers of the people from whom satisfaction is sought, he covers his head with a bonnet &mdash;the covering is of wool &mdash;and says: <quote>Hear, Jupiter; hear, ye boundaries of</quote> &mdash;naming whatever nation they belong to; &mdash;<quote>let righteousness hear!\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/> I am the public herald of the Roman People; I come duly and religiously commissioned; let my words be credited,</quote> Then he <pb id=\"p.117\"/>recites his demands, after which he takes Jupiter to<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 640-616</note> witness: <quote>If I demand unduly and against religion that these men and these things be surrendered to me, then let me never enjoy my native land.</quote>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"8\"/> These words he rehearses when he crosses the boundary line, the same to what man soever first meets him, the same when he enters the city gates, the same when he has come into the market-place, with only a few changes in the form and wording of the oath.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"9\"/> If those whom he demands are not surrendered, at the end of three and thirty days &mdash;for such is the conventional number &mdash;he declares war thus: <quote>Hear, Jupiter, and thou, Janus Quirinus, and hear all heavenly gods, and ye, gods of earth, and ye of the lower world; I call you to witness that this people</quote> &mdash;naming whatever people it is &mdash;<quote>is unjust, and does not make just reparation.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"10\"/> But of these matters we will take counsel of the elders in our country, how we may obtain our right.</quote> Then the messenger returns to Rome for the consultation.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"11\"/> Immediately the king would consult the Fathers, in some such words as these: <quote>Touching the things, the suits, the causes, concerning which the <hi rend=\"italics\">pater patratus</hi> of the Roman People of the Quirites has made demands on the <hi rend=\"italics\">pater patratus</hi> of the Ancient Latins, and upon the men of the Ancient Latins, which things they have not delivered, nor fulfilled, nor satisfied, being things which ought to have been delivered, fulfilled, and satisfied, speak,</quote> &mdash;turning to the man whose opinion he was wont to ask first, &mdash; <quote>what think you?</quote> Then the other would reply: <quote>I hold that those things ought to be sought in warfare just and righteous; and so I consent and vote.</quote>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"12\"/> The others were then asked the question, in their order, and when the majority <pb id=\"p.119\"/>of those present went over to the same opinion, war<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 640-616</note> had been agreed upon.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"13\"/> It was customary for the fetial to carry to the bounds of the other nation a cornet-wood spear, iron-pointed or hardened in the fire, and in the presence of not less than three grown men to say: <quote>Whereas the tribes of the Ancient Latins and men of the Ancient Latins have been guilty of acts and offences against the Roman People of the Quirites; and whereas the Roman People of the Quirites has commanded that war be made on the Ancient Latins, and the Senate of the Roman People has approved, agreed, and voted a war with the Ancient Latins; I therefore and the Roman People declare and make war on the tribes of the Ancient Latins and the men of the Ancient Latins.</quote>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"14\"/> Having said this, he would hurl his spear into their territory. This is the manner in which at that time redress was sought from the Latins and war was declared, and the custom has been received by later generations.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"chapter\" n=\"33\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>Ancus delegated the care of the sacrifices to the flamens and other priests, and having enlisted a new army proceeded to Politorium, one of the Latin cities. He took this place by storm, and adopting the plan of former kings, who had enlarged the state by making her enemies citizens, transferred the whole population to Rome.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> The Palatine was the quarter of the original Romans; on the one hand were the Sabines, who had the Capitol and the Citadel; on the other lay the Caelian, occupied by the Albans. The Aventine was therefore assigned to the newcomers, and thither too were sent shortly afterwards the citizens recruited from the captured towns of Tellenae and Ficana.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> Politorium was then attacked <pb id=\"p.121\"/>a second time, for having been left empty it had been<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 640-616</note> seized by the Ancient Latins, and this gave the Romans an excuse for razing the town, lest it should serve continually as a refuge for their enemies.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> In the end the Latin levies were all forced back upon Medullia, where for some time the fighting was indecisive and victory shifted from one side to the other; for the city was protected by fortifications and was defended by a strong garrison, and from their camp in the open plain the Latin army several times came to close quarters with the Romans.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> At last, throwing all his troops into the struggle, Ancus succeeded first in defeating the enemy\\'s army, and then in capturing the town, whence he returned to Rome enriched with immense spoils. On this occasion also many thousands of Latins were granted citizenship. These people, in order that the Aventine might be connected with the Palatine, were made to settle in the region of the Altar of Murcia.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> Janiculum was also annexed to the city, not from any lack of room, but lest it might some day become a stronghold of Rome\\'s enemies. It was decided not only to fortify it, but also to connect it with the City, for greater ease in passing to and fro, by a bridge of piles, the first bridge ever built over the Tiber.<note>This was the famous Pons Sublicius, <quote>Pile Bridge,</quote> made of wood, without metal of any sort.</note>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/> The Quirites\\' Ditch also, no small protection on the more level and accessible side of town, was the work of King Ancus.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p><milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"8\"/>When these enormous additions to the community had been effected, it was found that in so great a multitude the distinction between right and wrong had become obscured, and crimes were being secretly committed. Accordingly, to overawe men\\'s growing lawlessness, a prison was built in <pb id=\"p.123\"/>the midst of the city, above the Forum.<note>This prison, <hi rend=\"italics\">the</hi> Carcer, may still be seen at the foot of the Capitoline, between the Temple of Concord and the Curia. It is thought to be as old as any structure in Rome. It was used as a place of detention and execution for condemned criminals.</note>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"9\"/> And<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 640-616</note> this reign was a period of growth, not only for the City, but also for her lands and boundaries. The Maesian Forest was taken from the Veientes, extending Rome\\'s dominion clear to the sea; at the Tiber\\'s mouth the city of Ostia was founded, and salt-works were established near-by; while in recognition of signal success in war the temple of Jupiter Feretrius was enlarged.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"chapter\" n=\"34\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>In the reign of Ancus one Lucumo, a man of energy and wealth, took up his residence in Rome, chiefly from ambition and the hope that he might there achieve a station such as he had found no opportunity of attaining in Tarquinii; for though he had been born there himself, his race was alien to that place also.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> He was the son of Demaratus of Corinth, who had been driven from home by a political upheaval. Happening to settle in Tarquinii, he had married there and had two sons, named Lucumo and Arruns. Lucumo survived his father and inherited all his property; Arruns died before his father, leaving his wife with child.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> Demaratus did not long survive Arruns, and, unaware that his son\\'s wife was to become a mother, he died without making provision for his grandson in his will. When the babe was born his grandfather was dead, and having no share in the inheritance, he was given the name of Egerius,<note><hi rend=\"italics\">i.e.</hi> <quote>Necessitous.</quote></note> in consequence of his penniless condition.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> Lucumo, on the other hand, was heir to the whole estate. The self-confidence implanted in his bosom by his wealth was heightened by his marriage with Tanaquil, who was a woman of the most exalted birth, and not of a character lightly to endure a humbler rank in her new environment than she had <pb id=\"p.125\"/>enjoyed in the condition to which she had been born.<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 640-616</note>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> The Etruscans looked with disdain on Lucumo, the son of a banished man and a stranger. She could not endure this indignity, and forgetting the love she owed her native land, if she could only see her husband honoured, she formed the project of emigrating from Tarquinii.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> Rome appeared to be the most suitable place for her purpose; amongst a new people, where all rank was of sudden growth and founded on worth, there would be room for a brave and strenuous man; the City had been ruled by Tatius the Sabine, it had summoned Numa to the sovereignty from Cures, even Ancus was the son of a Sabine mother, and could point to no noble ancestor but Numa.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/> She had no trouble in persuading a man who was eager for distinction, to whom Tarquinii was only his mother\\'s birthplace.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"8\"/> They therefore gathered their possessions together and removed to Rome. They had come, as it happened, as far as Janiculum, when, as they were sitting in their covered waggon, an eagle poised on its wings gently descended upon them and plucked off Lucumo\\'s cap, after which, rising noisily above the car and again stooping, as if sent from heaven for that service, it deftly replaced the cap upon his head, and departed on high.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"9\"/> This augury was joyfully accepted, it is said, by Tanaquil, who was a woman skilled in celestial prodigies, as was the case with most Etruscans. Embracing her husband, she bade him expect transcendent greatness: such was the meaning of that bird, appearing from that quarter of the sky, and bringing tidings from that god; the highest part of the man had been concerned in the omen; the eagle had removed the adornment placed upon a mortal\\'s head that it might <pb id=\"p.127\"/>restore it with the divine approbation.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"10\"/> Such were<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 640-616</note> their hopes and their reflections as they entered the City. Having obtained a house, they gave out the name of Lucius Tarquinius Priscus.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"11\"/> The Romans regarded him with special interest, as a stranger and a man of wealth, and he steadily pushed his fortune by his own exertions, making friends wherever possible, by kind words, courteous hospitality, and benefactions, until his reputation extended even to the palace.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"12\"/> He had not long been known in this way to the king before the liberality and adroitness of his services procured him the footing of an intimate friend. He was now consulted in matters both of public and private importance, in time of war and in time of peace, and having been tested in every way was eventually even named in the king\\'s will as guardian of his children.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"chapter\" n=\"35\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>Ancus reigned four and twenty years, a<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 616-578</note> king inferior to none of his predecessors in the arts of peace and war and in the reputation they conferred. By this time his sons were nearly grown. Tarquinius was therefore all the more insistent in urging that the comitia should be held without delay to choose a king.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> When the meeting had been proclaimed, and the day drew near, he sent the boys away on a hunting expedition. Tarcuinius was the first, they say, to canvass votes for the kingship and to deliver a speech designed to win the favour of the commons.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> He pointed out that it; was no new thing he sought; he was not the first outsider to aim at the sovereignty in Rome &mdash;a thing which might have occasioned indignation and astonishment, &mdash;but the third. Tatius indeed, had been not merely an alien but an enemy when he was made king; while Numa was a stranger <pb id=\"p.129\"/>to the City, and, far from seeking the kingship, had<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 616-578</note> actually been invited to come and take it.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> As for himself, he had no sooner become his own master than he had removed to Rome with his wife and all his property. For the greater part of that period of life during which men serve the state he had lived in Rome, and not in the city of his birth.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> Both in civil life and in war he had had no mean instructor &mdash;King Ancus himself had taught him Roman laws and Roman rites. In subordination and deference to the king he had vied, he said, with all his hearers; in generosity to his fellow-subjects he had emulated the king himself.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> Hearing him advance these not unwarranted claims, the people, with striking unanimity, named him king. The result was that the man, so admirable in all other respects, continued even after he had obtained the sovereignty to manifest the same spirit of intrigue which had governed him in seeking it; and being no less concerned to strengthen his own power than to enlarge the state, he added a hundred members to the senate, who were known thenceforward as Fathers of the <quote>lesser families,</quote> and formed a party of unwavering loyalty to the king, to whom they owed their admission to the Curia.<note>The senate had doubtless shown its disapproval of the accession of Tarquinius, who now sought to render its opposition futile by doubling the membership and appointing none but his own supporters.</note>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p><milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/>His first war was with the Latins, whose town of Apiolae he took by storm. Returning thence with more booty than the rumours about the war had led people to expect, he exhibited games on a more splendid and elaborate scale than former kings had done.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"8\"/> It was then that the ground was first marked out for the circus now called Maximus. Places were divided amongst the Fathers and the knights where they might each make seats for themselves; these were called \\'rows.\\'\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"9\"/> They got their view from seats <pb id=\"p.131\"/>raised on props to a height of twelve feet from the<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 616-578</note> ground. The entertainment was furnished by horses and boxers, imported for the most part from Etruria. From that time the Games continued to be a regular annual show, and were called indifferently the Roman and the Great Games.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"10\"/> It was the same king, too, who apportioned building sites about the Forum among private citizens, and erected covered walks and booths.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"chapter\" n=\"36\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>He was also preparing to build a stone wall around the City, when a Sabine war interrupted his plans. And so sudden was the invasion, that they had crossed the Anio before the Roman army was able to march out and stop them, so that the City was thrown into a panic.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> The first battle was indecisive, with heavy losses on both sides. The enemy then withdrew into their camp, affording the Romans an opportunity to renew their preparations for the war. Tarquinius believed that cavalry was what he chiefly lacked. To the Ramnes, Titienses, and Luceres, the centuries which Romulus had enrolled, he therefore determined to add others, and to give them his own name as a permanent distinction.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> But since this was a matter in which Romulus had obtained the sanction of augury before acting, it was asserted by Attus Navius, a famous augur of those days, that no change or innovation could be introduced unless the birds had signified their approval.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> The king\\'s ire was aroused by this, and he is reported to have said, in derision of the science, <quote>Come now, divine seer! Inquire of your augury if that of which I am now thinking can come to pass.</quote> When Attus, having taken the auspices, replied that it would surely come to pass, the king said, <quote>Nay, but this is <pb id=\"p.133\"/>what I was thinking of, that you should cleave a<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 616-578</note> whetstone with a razor. Take them, and accomplish what your birds declare is possible!</quote> Whereupon, they say, the augur, without a sign of hesitation, cut the whetstone in two.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> There was a statue of Attus standing, with his head covered, on the spot where the thing was done, in the comitium, even at the steps on the left of the senate-house; tradition adds that the whetstone also was deposited in the same place, to be a memorial of that miracle to posterity.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> However this may be, auguries and the augural priesthood so increased in honour that nothing was afterwards done, in the field or at home, unless the auspices had first been taken: popular assemblies, musterings of the army, acts of supreme importance &mdash;all were put off when the birds refused their consent.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/> Neither did Tarquinius at that time make any change in the organization of the centuries of knights. Their numerical strength he doubled, so that there were now eighteen hundred knights, in three centuries.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"8\"/> But though enrolled under the old names, the new men were called the <quote>secondary knights,</quote> and the centuries are now, because doubled, known as the <quote>six centuries.</quote>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"chapter\" n=\"37\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>When this arm of the service had been enlarged, a second battle was fought with the Sabines. And in this, besides being increased in strength, the Roman army was further helped by a stratagem, for men were secretly dispatched to light a great quantity of firewood lying on the bank of the Anio, and throw it into the river. A favouring wind set the wood in a blaze, and the greater part of it lodged against the boats and piles, where it stuck fast and <pb id=\"p.135\"/>set the bridge on fire.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> This was another source of<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 616-578</note> alarm to the Sabines during the battle, and upon their being routed the same thing hindered their flight, so that many of them escaped the Romans only to perish in the stream; while their shields floated down the Tiber toward the City, and, being recognized, gave assurance that a victory had been won almost sooner than the news of it could be brought.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> In this battle the cavalry particularly distinguished themselves. They were posted on either flank of the Romans, and when the centre, composed of infantry, was already in retreat, they are said to have charged from both sides, with such effect that they not only checked the Sabine forces, which were pressing hotly forward as their enemy gave way, but suddenly put them to flight.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> The Sabines made for the mountains in a scattered rout, and indeed a few gained that refuge. Most of them, as has been said before, were driven by the cavalry into the river.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> Tarquinius thought it proper to follow up his victory while the other side was panic-stricken; he therefore sent the booty and the prisoners to Rome, and after making a huge pile of the captured arms and setting fire to it, in fulfilment of a vow to Vulcan, pushed forward at the head of his army into the enemy\\'s country.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> Although defeat had been the portion of the Sabines, and another battle could not be expected to result in better success, still, as the situation allowed no room for deliberation, they took the field with what soldiers they could hastily muster, and being then routed a second time and fairly reduced to extremities, they sued for peace.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"chapter\" n=\"38\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>Collatia, and what land the Sabines had on the hither side of Collatia, was taken from <pb id=\"p.137\"/>them, and Egerius, the son of the king\\'s brother, was<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 616-578</note> left in the town with a garrison.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> The surrender of the Collatini took place, I understand, in accordance with this formula: the king asked, <quote>Are you the legates and spokesmen sent by the People of Collatia to surrender yourselves and the People of Collatia?</quote> <quote>We are.</quote> <quote>Is the People of Collatia its own master?</quote> <quote>It is.</quote> <quote>Do you surrender yourselves and the People of Collatia, city, lands, water, boundary marks, shrines, utensils, all appurtenances, divine and human, into my power and that of the Roman People?</quote>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> <quote>We do.</quote> <quote>I receive the surrender.</quote> Upon the conclusion of the Sabine war Tarquinius returned to Rome and triumphed.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> He then made war against the Ancient Latins. In this campaign there was no general engagement at any point, but the king led his army from one town to another until he had subdued the entire Latin race. Corniculum, Ficulea Vetus, Cameria, Crustumerium, Ameriola, Medullia, and Nomentum &mdash;these were the towns which were captured from the Ancient Latins, or from those who had gone over to the Latins.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> Peace was then made.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>From that moment the king devoted himself to peaceful undertakings with an enthusiasm which was even greater than the efforts he had expended in waging war, so that there was no more rest for the people at home than there had been in the field.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> For he set to work to encircle the hitherto unfortified parts of the City with a stone wall, a task which had been interrupted by the Sabine war; and he drained the lowest parts of the City, about the Forum, and the other valleys between the hills, which were too flat to carry off the flood-waters easily, by means of sewers so made as to slope down toward the Tiber.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/> <pb id=\"p.139\"/>Finally, with prophetic anticipation of the splendour<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 616-578</note> which the place was one day to possess, he laid foundations for the temple of Jupiter on the Capitol, which he had vowed in the Sabine war.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"chapter\" n=\"39\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>At this time there happened in the house of the king a portent which was remarkable alike in its manifestation and in its outcome. The story is that while a child named Servius Tullius lay sleeping, his head burst into flames in the sight of many.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> The general outcry which so great a miracle called forth brought the king and queen to the place. One of the servants fetched water to quench the fire, but was checked by the queen, who stilled the uproar and commanded that the boy should not be disturbed until he awoke of himself. Soon afterwards sleep left him, and with it disappeared the flames.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> Then, taking her husband aside, Tanaquil said: <quote>Do you see this child whom we are bringing up in so humble a fashion? Be assured he will one day be a lamp to our dubious fortunes, and a protector to the royal house in the day of its distress. Let us therefore rear with all solicitude one who will lend high renown to the state and to our family.</quote>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> It is said that from that moment the boy began to be looked upon as a son, and to be trained in the studies by which men are inspired to bear themselves greatly. It was a thing easily accomplished, being the will of Heaven. The youth turned out to be of a truly royal nature, and when Tarquinius sought a son-in-law there was no other young Roman who could be at all compared to Servius; and the king accordingly betrothed his daughter to him.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> This great honour, for whatever cause conferred on him, forbids us to suppose that <pb id=\"p.141\"/>his mother was a slave and that he himself had been<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 616-578</note> in a state of servitude as a child. I am rather of the opinion of those who say, that on the capture of Corniculum, when Servius Tullius, the chief man of that city, had been slain, his wife, who was great with child, had been recognized amongst the other captive women, and on the score of her unique nobility had been rescued from slavery by the Roman queen, and had brought forth her child at Rome in the house of Priscus Tarquinius;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> in the sequel this act of generosity led to a growing intimacy between the women, and the boy, as one reared from childhood in the palace, was held in affection and esteem; it was his mother\\'s misfortune, who by the capture of her native town came into the power of its enemies, which gave rise to the belief that Servius was born of a slave woman.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"chapter\" n=\"40\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>It was now about thirty-eight years since Tarquinius had begun to reign, and not only the king, but the Fathers and the commons too, held Servius Tullius in the very highest honour.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> Now the two sons of Ancus had always considered it a great outrage that they had been ousted from their father\\'s kingship by the crime of their guardian, and that Rome should be ruled by a stranger whose descent was derived from a race not only remote but actually not even Italian.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> But their indignation was vastly increased by the prospect that even after Tarquinius\\' death the sovereignty would not revert to them, but, plunging down to yet baser depths, would fall into the hands of slaves; so that where, a hundred years before, Romulus, a god\\'s son and himself a god, had borne sway, so long as he remained on earth, in that self-same state a slave and <pb id=\"p.143\"/>the son of a slave woman would be king. It would<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 616-578</note> be not only a general disgrace to the Roman name, but particularly to their own house, if during the lifetime of Ancus\\' sons it should be open not only to strangers, but even to slaves to rule over the Romans.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> They therefore determined to repel that insult with the sword. But resentment at their wrong urged them rather against Tarquinius himself than against Servius, not only because the king, if he survived, would be more formidable to avenge the murder than a subject would be, but because if Servius should be dispatched it seemed probable that the kingdom would be inherited by whomsoever else Tarquinius might choose to be his son-in-law. For these reasons they laid their plot against the king himself.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> Two very desperate shepherds were selected to do the deed. Armed with the rustic implements to which they were both accustomed, they feigned a brawl in the entrance-court of the palace and, making as much noise as possible, attracted the attention of all the royal attendants; then they appealed to the king, until their shouts were heard inside the palace and they were sent for and came before him.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> At first each raised his voice and tried to shout the other down. Being repressed by the lictor and bidden to speak in turn, they finally ceased to interrupt each other, and one of them began to state his case, as they had planned beforehand.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/> While the king, intent upon the speaker, turned quite away from the other shepherd, the latter lifted his axe and brought it down upon his head. Then, leaving the weapon in the wound, they both ran out of doors.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"chapter\" n=\"41\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>The dying Tarquinius had hardly been caught <pb id=\"p.145\"/>up in the arms of the bystanders when the fugitives<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 616-578</note> were seized by the lictors. Then there was an uproar, as crowds hurried to the scene, asking one another in amazement what the matter was. In the midst of the tumult Tanaquil gave orders to close the palace, and ejected all witnesses. She busily got together the remedies needful for healing a wound, as if there were still hope, taking at the same time other measures to protect herself in case her hope should fail her.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> Having hastily summoned Servius, she showed him her husband\\'s nearly lifeless body, and grasping his right hand, besought him not to suffer the death of his father-in-law to go unpunished, nor his mother-in-law to become a jest to her enemies.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> <quote>To you, Servius,</quote> she cried, <quote>if you are a man, belongs this kingdom, not to those who by the hands of others have committed a dastardly crime. Arouse yourself and follow the guidance of the gods, who once declared by the token of divine fire poured out upon this head that you should be a famous man. Now is the time for that heaven-sent flame to quicken you! Now wake in earnest! We, too, were foreigners, yet we reigned. Consider what you are, not whence you were born. If your own counsels are benumbed in this sudden crisis, at least use mine.</quote>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> When the shouting and pushing of the crowd could hardly be withstood, Tanaquil went up into the upper storey of the house, and through a window looking out upon the Nova Via &mdash;for the king lived near the temple of Jupiter the Stayer &mdash; addressed the populace.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> She bade them be of good cheer: the king had been stunned by a sudden blow; the steel had not sunk deep into his body; he had already recovered consciousness; the blood had been <pb id=\"p.147\"/>wiped away and the wound examined; all the<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 616-578</note> symptoms were favourable; she trusted that they would soon see Tarquinius himself; meanwhile she commanded that the people should obey Servius Tullius, who would dispense justice and perform the other duties of the king.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> Servius went forth in the royal robe, accompanied by lictors, and sitting in the king\\'s seat rendered judgment in some cases, while in regard to others he gave out that he would consult the king. In this way for several days after Tarquinius had breathed his last he concealed his death, pretending that he was merely doing another\\'s work, while he was really strengthening his own position; then at last the truth was allowed to be known, from the lamentations which arose within the palace. Servius surrounded himself with a strong guard, and ruled at first without the authorization of the people, but with the consent of the Fathers.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/> The sons of Ancus, upon the arrest of the agents of their crime and the report that the king was alive and that Servius was so strong, had already gone into voluntary exile at Suessa Pometia.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"chapter\" n=\"42\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>Servius now took steps to assure his<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 578-534</note> position by private as well as public measures. In order that the sons of Tarquinius might not show the same animosity towards himself which the sons of Ancus had felt towards Tarquinius, he married his two daughters to the young princes, Lucius and Arruns Tarquinius.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> But he could not break the force of destiny by human wisdom; and jealousy of his power, even among the members of his household, created an atmosphere of treachery and hostility. Most opportune for the tranquil preservation <pb id=\"p.149\"/>of the existing state of things was a war which was<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 578-534</note> undertaken against the people of Veii &mdash;for the truce<note>Perhaps a reference to the hundred years\\' truce with Romulus (xv. 5), for Livy has not mentioned any war with Veii in the interval, though one is implied in the statement (xxxiii. 9) that the Veientes surrendered the Maesian Forest, in the reign of Ancus.</note> had now run out &mdash;and the other Etruscans.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> In this war the bravery and good fortune of Tullius were conspicuous; and when he had utterly defeated the vast army of his enemies, he found on returning to Rome that his title to the kingship was no longer questioned, whether he tested the feeling of the Fathers or that of the commons.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> He then addressed himself to what is by far the most important work of peace: as Numa had established religious law, so Servius intended that posterity should celebrate himself as the originator of all distinctions among the citizens, and of the orders which clearly differentiate the various grades of rank and fortune.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> For he instituted the census,<note>The organisation now to be described was primarily designed to increase the fighting strength of Rome. Formerly the right to bear arms had belonged solely to the patricians. Now plebeians were to be given a place in the army, which was to be reclassified according to every man\\'s property, <hi rend=\"italics\">i.e.</hi> his ability to provide himself a more or less complete equipment for the field. See Dion. Hal. iv. 16-21; Cic. <hi rend=\"italics\">Rep.</hi> ii. 39.</note> a most useful thing for a government destined to such wide dominion, since it would enable the burdens of war and peace to be borne not indiscriminately, as heretofore, but in proportion to men\\'s wealth. He then distributed the people into classes and centuries according to the following scale, which was based upon the census and was suitable either for peace or war: \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"chapter\" n=\"43\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>Out of those who had a rating of a hundred thousand assess<note>Capital, not income. The <hi rend=\"italics\">as</hi> was originally a rod of copper a foot long and divided into twelve inches (<hi rend=\"italics\">unciae</hi>). Some time during the regal period weight was substituted for measure in appraising the <hi rend=\"italics\">as,</hi> and it began to be stamped with the figure of an ox, which was the source of the Latin name for money, viz. <hi rend=\"italics\">pecunia.</hi> From being a full pound the <hi rend=\"italics\">as</hi> was gradually reduced, till, in the Second Punic War, it came to weigh only one ounce. What its value may have been in the time of Servius is a highly speculative question. See the note in the edition of Book I. by H. J. Edwards (pp. 179 ff.).</note> or more he made eighty <pb id=\"p.151\"/>centuries, forty each of seniors and of juniors; these<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 578-534</note> were all known as the first class; the seniors were to be ready to guard the city, the juniors to wage war abroad.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> The armour which these men were required to provide consisted of helmet, round shield, greaves, and breast-plate, all of bronze, for the protection of their bodies; their offensive weapons were a spear and a sword.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> There were added to this class two centuries of mechanics, who were to serve without arms; to them was entrusted the duty of fashioning siege-engines in war.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> The second class was drawn up out of those whose rating was between a hundred thousand and seventy-five thousand; of these, seniors and juniors, twenty centuries were enrolled. The arms prescribed for them were an oblong shield in place of the round one, and everything else, save for the breast-plate, as in the class above.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> He fixed the rating of the third class at fifty thousand; a like number of centuries was formed in this class as in the second, and with the same distinction of ages; neither was any change made in their arms, except that the greaves were omitted.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> In the fourth class the rating was twenty-five thousand; the same number of centuries was formed, but their equipment was changed, nothing being given them but a spear and a javelin.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/> The fifth class was made larger, and thirty centuries were formed. These men carried slings, with stones for missiles. Rated with them were the horn-blowers and trumpeters, divided into two centuries. Eleven thousand was the rating of this class.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"8\"/> Those who were assessed at less than this amount, being all the rest of the population, were made into a single century, exempt from military service. When the <pb id=\"p.153\"/>equipment and distribution of the infantry had been<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 578-534</note> thus provided for, Servius enrolled twelve centuries of knights out of the leading men of the state.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"9\"/> He likewise formed six other centuries &mdash;three had been instituted by Romulus &mdash;employing the same names which had been hallowed to their use by augury. For the purchase of horses they were allowed ten thousand asses each from the state treasury, and for the maintenance of these horses unmarried women were designated, who had to pay two thousand asses each, every year. All these burdens were shifted from the shoulders of the poor to those of the rich.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"10\"/> The latter were then granted special privileges: for manhood suffrage, implying equality of power and of rights, was no longer given promiscuously to all, as had been the practice handed down by Romulus and observed by all the other kings; but gradations were introduced, so that ostensibly no one should be excluded from the suffrage, and yet the power should rest with the leading citizens.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"11\"/> For the knights were called upon to vote first; then the eighty centuries of the first class: if there were any disagreement there, which rarely happened, it was provided that the centuries of the second class should be called; and they almost never descended so far as to reach the lowest citizens.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"12\"/> Nor ought it to cause any surprise that the present organization, which exists since the increase of the tribes to thirty-five, and the doubling of their number in the matter of the junior and senior centuries, does not correspond with the total established by Servius Tullius.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"13\"/> For, having divided the City according to its inhabited regions and hills into four parts, he named them <quote>tribes,</quote> a word <pb id=\"p.155\"/>derived, I suppose, from <quote>tribute</quote>;<note><hi rend=\"italics\">Tributum</hi> comes from <hi rend=\"italics\">tribus</hi> (not <hi rend=\"italics\">vice versa,</hi> as Livy has it), which meant originally <quote>third part,</quote> but lost the numerical force and became simply <quote>part,</quote> <quote>district,</quote> like the French <quote><hi rend=\"italics\">quartier,</hi></quote> which Walde compares.</note> for this<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 578-534</note> likewise the same king planned to have apportioned equitably, on the basis of the census; nor had these tribes anything whatever to do with the distribution or the number of the centuries.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"chapter\" n=\"44\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>Upon the completion of the census, which had been expedited by fear of a law that threatened with death and imprisonment those who failed to register, Servius issued a proclamation calling on all Roman citizens, both horse and foot, to assemble at daybreak, each in his own century, in the Campus Martius.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> There the whole army was drawn up, and a sacrifice of a pig, a sheep, and a bull was offered by the king for its purification. This was termed the <quote>closing of the lustrum,</quote> because it was the last act in the enrolment. Eighty thousand citizens are said to have been registered in that census; the most ancient of the historians, Fabius Pictor, adds that this was the number of those capable of bearing arms.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> To meet the wants of this population it was apparent that the City must expand, and so the king added two hills, the Quirinal and the Viminal, after which he proceeded to enlarge the Esquiline,<note>Dion. iv. 13, and Strabo, v. 3, 7, make Servius the first to include the Esquiline in the City. Livy appears to have thought of him as merely increasing the extent of that district. Conway and Walters adopt <hi rend=\"italics\">O\\'</hi>s <hi rend=\"italics\">Viminalemque, Viminalem,</hi> and Gronov\\'s <hi rend=\"italics\">Esquiliis,</hi> thus reconciling Livy with Dion and Strabo.</note> going there to live himself, that the place might obtain a good reputation. He surrounded the City with a rampart, trenches, and a wall, and so extended the <quote>pomerium.</quote>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> This word is interpreted by those who look only at its etymology as meaning <quote>the tract behind the wall,</quote> but it signifies rather <quote>the tract on both sides of the wall,</quote> the space which the Etruscans used formerly to consecrate with augural <pb id=\"p.157\"/>ceremonies, where they proposed to erect their wall,<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 578-534</note> establishing definite limits on either side of it, so that they might at the same time keep the walls free on their inward face from contact with buildings, which now, as a rule, are actually joined to them, and on the outside keep a certain area free from human uses.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> This space, which the gods forbade men to inhabit or to till, was called <quote>pomerium</quote> by the Romans, quite as much because the wall stood behind it as because it stood behind the wall; and as the city grew, these consecrated limits were always pushed out for as great a distance as the walls themselves were to be advanced.<note><hi rend=\"italics\">Pomerium</hi> at first meant the boundary-line itself, then the strip of land left free within the wall, and finally was loosely used of the strip on both sides of the wall.</note>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"chapter\" n=\"45\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>When the king had promoted the grandeur of the state by enlarging the City, and had shaped all his domestic policy to suit the demands of peace as well as those of war, he was unwilling that arms should always be the means employed for strengthening Rome\\'s power, and sought to increase her sway by diplomacy, and at the same time to add something to the splendour of the City.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> Even at that early date the temple of Diana at Ephesus enjoyed great renown. It was reputed to have been built through the cooperation of the cities of Asia, and this harmony and community of worship Servius praised in superlative terms to the Latin nobles, with whom, both officially and in private, he had taken pains to establish a footing of hospitality and friendship.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> By dint of reiterating the same arguments he finally carried his point, and a shrine of Diana was built in Rome by the nations of Latium conjointly with the Roman People. This was an admission that Rome was the capital &mdash;a point which had so often been disputed <pb id=\"p.159\"/>with force of arms. But though it seemed that the<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 578-534</note> Latins had lost all interest in this contention after the repeated failure of their appeals to war, there was one man amongst the Sabines who thought that he saw an opportunity to recover the empire by a shrewd plan of his own.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> In the Sabine country, on the farm of a certain head of a family, there was born a heifer of extraordinary size and beauty;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> a marvel to which the horns afterwards bore testimony, for they were fastened up for many generations in the vestibule of Diana\\'s temple.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> This heifer was regarded as a prodigy, as indeed it was; soothsayers prophesied that the state whose citizens should sacrifice the animal to Diana would be the seat of empire, and this prediction had reached the ears of the priest of Diana\\'s shrine. On the earliest day which seemed suitable for the sacrifice, the Sabine drove the heifer to Rome, and bringing her to the shrine of Diana, led her up to the altar. There the Roman priest, moved by the great size of the victim, which had been much talked of, and recalling the prophecy, asked the Sabine, <quote>What is this that you are doing, stranger? Would you sacrifice, unpurified, to Diana? Not so! First bathe in a running stream; the Tiber flows by in the bottom of the valley.</quote>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/> The stranger, touched by a scruple and wishing to do everything according to ritual, that the prodigy might be answered by the event, at once descended to the Tiber. Meanwhile the Roman offered the heifer to Diana, an act which was exceedingly acceptable to the king and the citizens.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"chapter\" n=\"46\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>Servius had by this time a definite prescriptive right to the supreme power. Still, hearing <pb id=\"p.161\"/>that the young Tarquinius now and then threw out<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 578-534</note> a hint that he was reigning without the consent of the people, he proceeded to gain the goodwill of the commons by dividing among all the citizens the land obtained by conquest from the enemy; after which he made bold to call upon the people to vote whether he should be their ruler, and was declared king with such unanimity as none of his predecessors had experienced.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> Yet the circumstance did not lessen Tarquinius\\'s hopes of obtaining the kingship. On the contrary, perceiving that the bestowal of land on the plebeians was in opposition to the wishes of the senate, he felt that he had got the better opportunity of vilifying Servius to the Fathers and of increasing his own influence in the senate-house. He was a hot-headed youth himself, and he had at hand, in the person of Tullia his wife, one who goaded on his restless spirit.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> For the royal house of Rome produced an example of tragic guilt, as others had done,<note>The reference is to the stories of Atreus and Oedipus.</note> in order that loathing of kings might hasten the coming of liberty, and that the end of reigning might come in that reign which was the fruit of crime.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> This Lucius Tarquinius &mdash;whether he was the son or the grandson of King Tarquinius Priscus is uncertain; but, following the majority of historians, I would designate him son &mdash;had a brother, Arruns Tarquinius, a youth of a gentle disposition.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> These two, as has been said before, had married the two Tullias, daughters of the king, themselves of widely different characters. Chance had so ordered matters that the two violent natures should not be united in wedlock, thanks doubtless to the good fortune of the Roman People, that the reign of Servius might be prolonged and the traditions of <pb id=\"p.163\"/>the state become established.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> It was distressing to<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 578-534</note> the headstrong Tullia that her husband should be destitute of ambition and enterprise. With her whole soul she turned from him to his brother; him she admired, him she called a man and a prince: she despised her sister because, having got a man for a mate, she lacked a woman\\'s daring.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/> Their similarity soon brought these two together, as is generally the case, for evil is strongly drawn to evil; but it was the woman who took the lead in all the mischief. Having become addicted to clandestine meetings with another\\'s husband, she spared no terms of insult when speaking of her own husband to his brother, or of her sister to that sister\\'s husband. She urged that it would have been juster for her to be unmarried and for him to lack a wife than for them to be united to their inferiors and be compelled to languish through the cowardice of others.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"8\"/> If the gods had given her the man she deserved she would soon have seen in her own house the royal power which she now saw in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"9\"/> her father\\'s. It was not long before she had inspired the young man with her own temerity, and, having made room in their respective houses for a new marriage, by deaths which followed closely upon one another, they were joined together in nuptials which Servius rather tolerated than approved.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"chapter\" n=\"47\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>From that moment the insecurity of the aged Tullius and the menace to his authority increased with each succeeding day. For the woman was already looking forward from one crime to another, nor would she allow her husband any rest by night or day, lest the murders they had done before should be without effect.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> She had not wanted a <pb id=\"p.165\"/>man just to be called a wife, just to endure<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 578-534</note> servitude with him in silence; she had wanted one who should deem himself worthy of the sovereignty, who bethought him that he was the son of Tarquinius Priscus, who preferred the possession of the kingship to the hope of it.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> <quote>If you are he,</quote> she cried, <quote><hi rend=\"italics\">whom</hi> I thought I was marrying, I call you both man and king; if not, then I have so far changed for the worse, in that crime is added, in your case, to cowardice. Come, rouse yourself!\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> You are not come, like your father, from Corinth or Tarquinii, that you must make yourself king in a strange land; the gods of your family and your ancestors, your father\\'s image, the royal palace, with its throne, and the name of Tarquinius create and proclaim you king. Else, if you have no courage for this, why do you cheat the citizens? why do you suffer yourself to be looked on as a prince? Away with you to Tarquinii or Corinth!\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> Sink back into the rank of your family, more like your brother than your father!</quote> With these and other taunts she excited the young man\\'s ambition.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> Nor could she herself submit with patience to the thought that Tanaquil, a foreign woman, had exerted her spirit to such purpose as twice in succession to confer the royal power &mdash;upon her husband first, and again upon her son-in-law &mdash; if Tullia, the daughter of a king, were to count for nothing in bestowing and withdrawing a throne. Inspired by this woman\\'s frenzy Tarquinius began to go about and solicit support, especially among the heads of the lesser families, whom he reminded of his father\\'s kindness to them, and desired their favour in return; the young men he attracted by gifts; both by the great things he promised to do <pb id=\"p.167\"/>himself, and by slandering the king as well, he<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 578-534</note> everywhere strengthened his interest.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/> At length, when it seemed that the time for action was now come, he surrounded himself with a body of armed men and burst into the Forum.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"8\"/> Then, amidst the general consternation which ensued, he seated himself on the throne in front of the Curia, and commanded, by the mouth of a herald, that the senators should come to King Tarquinius at the senate-house. They at once assembled: some of them already prepared beforehand, others afraid that they might be made to suffer for it if they did not come; for they were astounded at this strange and wonderful sight, and supposed that Servius was utterly undone.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"9\"/> Tarquinius then went back to the very beginning of Servius\\'s family and abused the king for a slave and a slave-woman\\'s son who, after the shameful death of his own father, Tarquinius Priscus, had seized the power;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"10\"/> there had been no observance of the interregnum, as on former occasions; there had been no election held; not by the votes of the people had sovereignty come to him, not with the confirmation of the Fathers, but by a woman\\'s gift.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"11\"/> Such having been his birth, and such his appointment to the kingship, he had been an abettor of the lowest class of society, to which he himself belonged, and his hatred of the nobility possessed by others had led him to plunder the leading citizens of their land and divide it amongst the dregs of the populace.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"12\"/> All the burdens which had before been borne in common he had laid upon the nation\\'s foremost men. He had instituted the census that he might hold up to envy the fortunes of the wealthy, and make them available, when he chose to draw upon them, for largesses to the destitute.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> <pb id=\"p.169\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"chapter\" n=\"48\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>In the midst of this harangue Servius,<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 578-534</note> who had been aroused by the alarming news, came up and immediately called out in a loud voice from the vestibule of the Curia: <quote>What means this, Tarquinius?\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> With what assurance have you dared, while I live, to convene the Fathers or to sit in my chair?</quote> Tarquinius answered truculently that it was his own father\\'s seat he occupied; that the king\\'s son was a fitter successor to his kingdom than a slave was; that Tullius had long enough been suffered to mock his masters and insult them. Shouts arose from the partisans of each, and the people began to rush into the senate-house; it was clear that he would be king who won the day.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> Tarquinius was now compelled by sheer necessity to go on boldly to the end. Being much superior to Servius in youth and strength, he seized him by the middle, and bearing him out of the senate-house, flung him down the steps. He then went back into the Curia to hold the senate together.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> The king\\'s servitors and companions fled. The king himself, half fainting, was making his way home without the royal attendants, when the men whom Tarquinius had sent in pursuit of the fugitive came up with him and killed him.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> It is believed, inasmuch as it is not inconsistent with the rest of her wickedness, that this deed was suggested by Tullia. It is agreed, at all events, that she was driven in her carriage into the Forum, and nothing abashed at the crowd of men, summoned her husband from the Curia and was the first to hail him king.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> Tarquinius bade her withdraw from so turbulent a scene. On her way home she had got to the top of the Vicus Cyprius, where the shrine of Diana recently stood, and was bidding her driver <pb id=\"p.171\"/>turn to the right into the Clivus Urbius, to take her<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 578-534</note> to the Esquiline Hill, when the man gave a start of terror, and pulling up the reins pointed out to his mistress the prostrate form of the murdered Servius.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/> Horrible and inhuman was the crime that is said to have ensued, which the place commemorates &mdash;men call it the Street of Crime &mdash;for there, crazed by the avenging spirits of her sister and her former husband, they say that Tullia drove her carriage over her father\\'s corpse, and, herself contaminated and defiled, carried away on her vehicle some of her murdered father\\'s blood to her own and her husband\\'s penates, whose anger was the cause that the evil beginning of this reign was, at no long date, followed by a similar end.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p><milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"8\"/>Servius Tullius had ruled forty-four years, so well that even a good and moderate successor would have found it hard to emulate him.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"9\"/> But there was this to enhance his renown, that just and lawful kingship perished with him. Yet, mild and moderate though his sway was, some writers state that he had intended to resign it, as being a government by one man, had not the crime of one of his family interrupted his plans for the liberation of his country.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"chapter\" n=\"49\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>Now began the reign of Lucius Tarquinius,<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 534-510</note> whose conduct procured him the surname of Superbus, or the Proud.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> For he denied the rites of sepulture to his own father-in-law, asserting that Romulus had also perished without burial. He put to death the leading senators, whom he believed to have favoured the cause of Servius and, conscious that a precedent for gaining the kingship by crime might be found in his own career and turned against himself, he <pb id=\"p.173\"/>assumed a body-guard.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> He had indeed no right to<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 534-510</note> the throne but might, since he was ruling neither by popular decree nor senatorial sanction.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> Moreover, as he put no trust in the affection of his people, he was compelled to safeguard his authority by fear. To inspire terror therefore in many persons, he adopted the practice of trying capital causes<note><hi rend=\"italics\">i.e.</hi> causes affecting the <hi rend=\"italics\">caput</hi> (which might mean either <quote>life</quote> or <quote>civic rights</quote>) of the accused.</note> by himself, without advisers;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> and, under the pretext thus afforded, was able to inflict death, exile, and forfeiture of property, not only upon persons whom he suspected and disliked, but also in cases where he could have nothing to gain but plunder.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> It was chiefly the senators whose numbers were reduced by this procedure, and Tarquinius determined to make no new appointments to the order, that it might be the more despised for its very paucity, and might chafe less at being ignored in all business of state.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/> For this king was the first to break with the custom handed down by his predecessors, of consulting the senate on all occasions, and governed the nation without other advice than that of his own household. War, peace, treaties, and alliances were entered upon or broken off by the monarch himself, with whatever states he wished, and without the decree of people or senate.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"8\"/> The Latin race he strove particularly to make his friends, that his strength abroad might contribute to his security at home. He contracted with their nobles not only relations of hospitality but also matrimonial connections.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"9\"/> To Octavius Mamilius of Tusculum, a man by long odds the most important of the Latin name, and descended, if we may believe report, from Ulysses and the goddess Circe,<note>Circe bore to Ulysses a son, Telegonus, who founded Tusculum.</note> he gave his daughter in marriage, and in this way attached to himself the numerous kinsmen and friends of the man.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> <pb id=\"p.175\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"chapter\" n=\"50\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>Tarquinius had already won great influence<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 534-510</note> with the Latin nobles, when he gave notice that they should assemble on a certain day at the grove of Ferentina, saying that there were matters of common interest which he wished to discuss.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> The Latins gathered at daybreak in large numbers; Tarquinius himself, though he did indeed keep the day, arrived but a little while before sundown. There had been much talk in the council all day about various subjects. Turnus Herdonius of Aricia had inveighed violently against the absent Tarquinius.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> He said it was no wonder he had been given the name of Superbus at Rome &mdash;for that was the name by which they already called him, secretly and in whispers, but still quite generally; &mdash;could anything be more overbearing than to flout the whole Latin race as he was doing then?\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> Their leaders had been summoned from distant homes, and the very man who had called the council was not there. He was evidently trying their patience, intending, if they submitted to the yoke, to use them as his vassals. For who could fail to see that he was aiming at sovereignty over the Latins?\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> If his own people had done well to intrust this to him, if indeed it had been intrusted to him at all, and had not been ravished by foul murder, then it was right that the Latins also should intrust it to him &mdash;nay,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> not even then, for he was of foreign birth; but if his own subjects were weary of him, as men who, one after another, were being made to suffer death, exile, confiscation, what better prospect was held out to the Latins? If they were guided by the speaker they would depart every man to his own home, nor observe the day of meeting more than he who had proclaimed it was observing it.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/> As these <pb id=\"p.177\"/>words and others of the same import were being<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 534-510</note> uttered by the factious and turbulent Latin, who owed to these qualities his influence amongst his own people, Tarquinius came up.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"8\"/> This was the end of the speech; all turned to salute Tarquinius. Silence was commanded, and the king, being advised by those nearest him to excuse himself for having come so late, declared that he had been chosen arbiter between a father and his son, and had been delayed by his anxiety to reconcile them. He added that since this business had used up that day, he would take up on the morrow the matters which he had meant to bring before them.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"9\"/> They say that Turnus would not suffer even this to go unchallenged, asserting that there was no question more quickly settled than one betwixt father and son, for these few words were enough to end it: <quote>Unless you obey your father it will be the worse for you.</quote>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"chapter\" n=\"51\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>Girding thus against the Roman king, the Arician quitted the council. Tarquinius was considerably more vexed than he appeared to be, and at once looked about him for the means of destroying Turnus, that he might inspire in the Latins the same terror with which he had broken the spirit of the Romans.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> And since he could not openly put his man to death by virtue of sovereign right, he charged him with a crime of which he was innocent, and so destroyed him. Through the agency of certain men of the opposite party in Aricia, he bribed a slave of Turnus with gold to allow a large quantity of swords to be brought secretly into his master\\'s lodging.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> Having accomplished this in a single night, Tarquinius, shortly before dawn, summoned the chief men of the Latins to his quarters, pretending to <pb id=\"p.179\"/>have received alarming news, and informed them<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 534-510</note> that his tardiness on the preceding day, as though somehow providentially occasioned, had been the means of saving himself and them.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> For he was told that Turnus was plotting his murder and that of the chief men of the different cities, that he might be sole ruler over the Latins. He would have attacked them the day before in the council, but had postponed the attempt because the summoner of the council, whom he chiefly aimed at, was not there.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> That was the reason Turnus had railed at him in his absence, for his delay had balked the Arician\\'s expectation. Tarquinius said that he had no doubt, if his information was true, that Turnus would come at dawn, when they had assembled in the council, and would be armed and attended by a band of conspirators.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> It was said that a great quantity of swords had been carried to his lodging; the falsity or truth of this could be ascertained immediately, and he asked them to go with him to Turnus\\'s quarters.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/> The charge was made plausible both by the aggressive spirit of Turnus and his speech of the day before, and by Tarquinius\\'s delay, since it seemed that the massacre might have been postponed on that account. The nobles went therefore with a disposition to believe the story, but still, if the swords should not be found, they were prepared to conclude the other charges false.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"8\"/> As soon as they reached the place they wakened Turnus from his sleep and surrounded him with guards; and having overpowered the slaves, who out of affection for their master would have resorted to force, they proceeded to pull out the hidden swords from every corner of the inn. There was now no doubt that Turnus was <pb id=\"p.181\"/>caught in the act, and he was cast into chains, while<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 534-510</note> the summons was instantly sent out, amidst intense excitement, for a council of the Latins.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"9\"/> There such bitter resentment was aroused by the public display of the swords, that the accused was not permitted to plead his cause, but suffered a new kind of death, being plunged into the source of the Ferentine Water and sunk beneath a wicker crate heaped up with stones.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"chapter\" n=\"52\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>Tarquinius then called the Latins again to the place of council, and praised them for the punishment which they had justly meted out to the rebellious attempt of Turnus, in view of the treason in which he had just been taken.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> The king then went on to say that it was in his power to proceed according to an ancient right, since all the Latins, having sprung from Alba, were included in that treaty by which, from the time of Tullus, the whole Alban state, with its colonies, had come under Rome\\'s dominion.<note>In the account of this treaty at xxiv. 3 no Alban colonies are mentioned, nor do we know of any. Conway and Walters, therefore, keep <hi rend=\"italics\">colonis</hi> of the MSS., but we should rather expect <hi rend=\"italics\">civibus</hi> in this context.</note>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> But the advantage of all would be better served, he thought, if that treaty were renewed and the good fortune of the Roman people were thrown open to the participation of the Latins, than if they were always to be dreading or enduring the razing of their cities and the devastation of their lands which they had suffered first in Ancus\\'s reign and afterward in that of the speaker\\'s father.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> It was not difficult to persuade the Latins, although the Roman interest preponderated in this treaty. For the rest, they saw that the chiefs of the Latin name stood with the king and took his view of the matter, and they had just been given a demonstration of the danger they would each incur if they opposed the project.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> So the treaty was renewed, and the Latin <pb id=\"p.183\"/>juniors were commanded to present themselves at<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 534-510</note> the grove of Ferentina on a certain day, armed and in full force, as the treaty prescribed.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> When they had assembled, agreeably to the king\\'s edict, from the different districts, Tarquinius was unwilling that they should have their own leaders, or a separate command, or their own standards; he therefore mingled Latins and Romans in the maniples, making one maniple of two and two of one, and over the maniples thus doubled he put centurions.<note>A Roman maniple was divided into halves, and each half was combined with the half of a Latin maniple, similarly divided, to form a new unit. The maniples were not, strictly speaking, doubled.</note>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"chapter\" n=\"53\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>But if the king was unjust in peace, yet he was not a bad general in war. Indeed, he would have equalled in this art the kings who had gone before him, if his degeneracy in other things had not also dimmed his glory here.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> It was he who began the war with the Volsci which was to last more than two hundred years after his time, and took Suessa Pometia from them by storm.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> There, having sold off the booty and raised forty talents of silver,<note>As Livy gives the sum in talents, it has been suggested that he may here be following Fabius Pictor, whose history was written in Greek. The Euboic talent was worth roughly &pound;220 or $1,060.</note> he conceived the project of a temple of Jupiter so magnificent that it should be worthy of the king of gods and men, the Roman empire, and the majesty of the site itself. The money from the captured city he put aside to build this temple.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p><milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/>He then engaged in an unexpectedly tedious war with Gabii, a neighbouring town After first assaulting the place in vain, he laid siege to it, but this attempt was as unsuccessful as the other, for he was driven off from the walls; and he finally resorted to the policy, so unlike a Roman, of deceit <pb id=\"p.185\"/>and trickery.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> For he pretended to have given up<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 534-510</note> the war and to be engrossed in laying the foundations of his temple and in other city works, arranging meanwhile to let Sextus, who was the youngest of his three sons, desert to Gabii, and there complain that his father was intolerably cruel to him.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> His father\\'s pride, he said, was now diverted from strangers upon his own family. Even his children were too many to please him, and the solitude which he had caused in the senate-house he wished to bring to pass in his own home also, that he might leave no descendant, no heir to his kingdom.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/> The young man said that he had himself escaped from amidst the swords and javelins of his father, and had made up his mind that there was no safety for him anywhere save with the enemies of Lucius Tarquinius. Let them not delude themselves, he said; the war which the king pretended to have abandoned was still awaiting them, and when the chance offered he would attack them unawares.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"8\"/> But if they had no room for suppliants, he was prepared to wander all over Latium, and thence seek out the Volsci and the Aequi and the Hernici, till at last he should come to people who knew how to protect a son from the cruel and wicked tortures inflicted on him by a father.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"9\"/> Possibly he might even discover some enthusiasm for war and arms against the haughtiest of kings and the most insolent of nations.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"10\"/> When it appeared that if they were indifferent he would leave them in anger and continue his flight, the Gabini bade him welcome. They told him not to be surprised if the king had been the same to his children that he had been to his subjects, to his allies; he would end by venting his cruelty upon <pb id=\"p.187\"/>himself if other objects failed him.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"11\"/> But for their<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 534-510</note> own part, they said, they were glad of his coming, and they believed that in a short time, with his help, the seat of war would be shifted from the gates of Gabii to the walls of Rome.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"chapter\" n=\"54\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>Sextus next obtained admission to the Gabian councils of state, where, on all subjects but one, he professed a deference for the opinion of those who had long been citizens of Gabii and were better acquainted with the facts. War, however, he did take it upon himself to urge, again and again; and in so doing he assumed a special competence, as one who was acquainted with the strength of both nations, and knew that the king\\'s pride must necessarily be hateful to all the citizens, since even his children had not been able to put up with it.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> In this way, little by little, he stirred up the leaders of the Gabini to reopen the war. He would himself take the boldest of the young men and go upon raids and forays. All his words and acts were calculated to deceive, and their ill-grounded confidence so increased that in the end he was chosen commander-in-chief.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> The war began, and the people had no suspicion of what was going forward. Skirmishes took place between Rome and Gabii, in which, as a rule, the Gabini had the best of it. Thereupon their citizens, both high and low, contended who should be loudest in expressing the belief that in Sextus Tarquinius they had a heaven-sent leader.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> And the soldiers, seeing him ever ready to share in their dangers and hardships, and ever lavish in distributing the plunder, came to love him so devotedly that the elder Tarquinius was not more truly master <pb id=\"p.189\"/>in Rome than was his son in Gabii.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> And so, when<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 534-510</note> Sextus saw that he had acquired strength enough for any enterprise, he despatched one of his own followers to his father in Rome, to ask what the king might please to have him do, since the gods had granted that at Gabii all power in the state should rest with him alone.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> To this messenger, I suppose because he seemed not quite to be trusted, no verbal reply was given. The king, as if absorbed in meditation, passed into the garden of his house, followed by his son\\'s envoy. There, walking up and down without a word, he is said to have struck off the heads of the tallest poppies with his stick.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/> Tired of asking questions and waiting for an answer, the messenger returned to Gabii, his mission, as he thought, unaccomplished. He reported what he had said himself and what he had seen. Whether from anger, or hatred, or native pride, the king, he said, had not pronounced a single word.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"8\"/> As soon as it was clear to Sextus what his father meant and what was the purport of his silent hints, he rid himself of the chief men of the state. Some he accused before the people; against others he took advantage of the odium they had themselves incurred. Many were openly executed; some, whom it would not have looked well to accuse, were put to death in secret.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"9\"/> Some were permitted, if they chose, to leave the country; or they were driven into banishment, and once out of the way, their property was forfeited, just as in the case of those who had been put to death.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"10\"/> Thence came largesses and spoils, and in the sweetness of private gain men lost their feeling for the wrongs of the nation, until, deprived of counsel and aid, the state of Gabii was handed over unresisting to the Roman king.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> <pb id=\"p.191\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"chapter\" n=\"55\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>Having got possession of Gabii, Tarquinius<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 534-510</note> made peace with the Aequian nation and renewed the treaty with the Etruscans. He next turned his attention to affairs in the city. Here his first concern was to build a temple of Jupiter on the Tarpeian Mount<note><hi rend=\"italics\">i.e.</hi> the Capitoline. So Propertius calls the Capitoline Jupiter <quote>Tarpeius Pater</quote> (IV. i. 7).</note> to stand as a memorial of his reign and of his name, testifying that of the two Tarquinii, both kings, the father had made the vow and the son had fulfilled it.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> And that the site might be free from all other religious claims and belong wholly to Jupiter and his temple, which was building there, he determined to annul the consecration of several fanes and shrines which had been first vowed by King Tatius at the crisis of the battle against Romulus, and had afterwards been consecrated and inaugurated.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> At the very time when he began this task the gods are said to have exerted their power to show the magnitude of this mighty empire. For whereas the birds permitted that the consecrations of all the other shrines should be rescinded, they refused their consent for the shrine of Terminus.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> This omen and augury was thus construed: the fact that the seat of Terminus was not moved, and that of all the gods he alone was not called away from the place consecrated to him, meant that the whole kingdom would be firm and steadfast.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> When this auspice of permanence had been received, there followed another prodigy foretelling the grandeur of their empire. A human head, its features intact, was found, so it is said, by the men who were digging for the foundations of the temple.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> This appearance plainly foreshowed that here was to be the citadel of the empire and the head of the world, and such was the interpretation of the soothsayers, both those who were in <pb id=\"p.193\"/>the City and those who were called in from Etruria<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 534-510</note> to consider the matter.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/> This made the king all the more ready to spend money on the work. Hence the Pometian spoils, which had been destined to carry the building up to the roof, barely sufficed for the foundations.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"8\"/> This disposes me to believe the statement of Fabius (who is, besides, the earlier writer) that the spoils were only forty talents, rather than Piso\\'s, who writes that forty thousand pounds of silver were put aside for this work.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"9\"/> So great a sum of money could not be expected from the booty of a single city of that time, and there is no building, even among those of our own day, for the foundations of which it would not be more than enough.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"chapter\" n=\"56\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>Being intent upon completing the temple, the king called in workmen from every quarter of Etruria, and used for this purpose not only the state funds but labourers drawn from the commons. This work was far from light in itself, and was added to their military service. Yet the plebeians felt less abused at having to build with their own hands the temples of the gods, than they did when they came to be transferred to other tasks also, which, while less in show, were yet rather more laborious.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> I mean the erection of seats in the circus, and the construction underground of the Great Sewer, as a receptacle for all the offscourings of the City, &mdash;two works for which the new splendour of these days has scarcely been able to produce a match.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> After making the plebeians toil at these hard tasks, the king felt that a populace which had now no work to do was only a burden to the City; he wished, moreover, by sending out settlers, to extend the frontiers of his dominions.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> <pb id=\"p.195\"/>He therefore sent colonists to Signia and Circei, to<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 534-510</note> safeguard the City by land and sea.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>While he was thus occupied, a terrible portent appeared. A snake glided out of a wooden pillar, causing fright and commotion in the palace. As for the king himself, his heart was not so much struck with sudden terror as filled with anxious forebodings.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> Now for public prodigies none but Etruscan soothsayers were wont to be employed, but this domestic apparition, as he regarded it, so thoroughly alarmed him that he determined to send to Delphi, the most famous oracle in the world;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> and, not daring to trust the oracle\\'s reply to anybody else, he sent two of his sons, through strange lands, as they were then, and over stranger seas, to Greece.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/> Titus and Arruns were the ones who went; and, to bear them company, Lucius Junius Brutus was sent too, the son of Tarquinia, sister of the king, a young man of a very different mind from that which he pretended to bear. Having heard that the leading men of the state, and among them his own brother, had been put to death by his uncle, he determined to leave nothing in his disposition which the king might justly fear, nor anything in his fortune to covet, resolving to find safety in contempt, where justice afforded no protection.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"8\"/> He therefore deliberately assumed the appearance of stupidity, and permitted himself and his property to become the spoil of the king; he even accepted the surname Brutus,<note>Literally <quote>Dullard.</quote></note> that behind the screen afforded by this title the great soul which was to free the Roman People might bide its time unseen.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"9\"/> He it was who was then taken by the Tarquinii to Delphi, more as a butt than as a comrade; and he is said to have carried a golden staff inclosed within one <pb id=\"p.197\"/>of cornel wood, hollowed out to receive it, as a gift<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 534-510</note> to Apollo, and a roundabout indication of his own character.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"10\"/> When they came there, and had carried out their father\\'s instructions, a desire sprang up in the hearts of the youths to find out which one of them should be king at Rome. From the depths of the cavern this answer, they say, was returned: <quote>The highest power at Rome shall be his, young men, who shall be first among you to kiss his mother.</quote>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"11\"/> The Tarquinii, anxious that Sextus, who had been left in Rome, might know nothing of the answer and have no share in the rule, gave orders that the incident should be kept strictly secret; as between themselves, they decided by lot which should be first, upon their return to Rome, to give their mother a kiss.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"12\"/> Brutus thought the Pythian utterance had another meaning; pretending to stumble, he fell and touched his lips to Earth, evidently regarding her as the common mother of all mortals.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"13\"/> They then returned to Rome, where preparations for war with the Rutuli were being pushed with the greatest vigour.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"chapter\" n=\"57\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>Ardea belonged to the Rutuli, who were a nation of commanding wealth, for that place and period. This very fact was the cause of the war, since the Roman king was eager not only to enrich himself, impoverished as he was by the splendour of his public works, but also to appease with booty the feeling of the common people;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> who, besides the enmity they bore the monarch for other acts of pride, were especially resentful that the king should have kept them employed so long as artisans and doing the work of slaves.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> An attempt was made to capture Ardea by assault. Having failed in this, the Romans invested <pb id=\"p.199\"/>the place with intrenchments, and began to beleaguer<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 534-510</note> the enemy.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> Here in their permanent camp, as is usual with a war not sharp but long drawn out, furlough was rather freely granted, more freely however to the leaders than to the soldiers; the young princes for their part passed their idle hours together at dinners and drinking bouts.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> It chanced, as they were drinking in the quarters of Sextus Tarquinius, where Tarquinius Collatinus, son of Egerius, was also a guest, that the subject of wives came up.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> Every man fell to praising his own wife with enthusiasm, and, as their rivalry grew hot, Collatinus said that there was no need to talk about it, for it was in their power to know, in a few hours\\' time, how far the rest were excelled by his own Lucretia.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/> <quote>Come! If the vigour of youth is in us let us mount our horses and see for ourselves the disposition of our wives. Let every man regard as the surest test what meets his eyes when the woman\\'s husband enters unexpected.</quote> They were heated with wine. <quote>Agreed!</quote>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"8\"/> they all cried, and clapping spurs to their horses were off for Rome. Arriving there at early dusk, they thence proceeded to Collatia, where Lucretia was discovered very differently employed from the daughters-in-law of the king.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"9\"/> These they had seen at a luxurious banquet, whiling away the time with their young friends; but Lucretia, though it was late at night, was busily engaged upon her wool, while her maidens toiled about her in the lamplight as she sat in the hall of her house.<note>A similar scene is imagined by Tibullus, I. iii. 83 ff. (p. 211 of the volume in this series).</note>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"10\"/> The prize of this contest in womanly virtues fell to Lucretia. As Collatinus and the Tarquinii approached, they were graciously received, and the victorious husband courteously invited the young princes to his table. It was there <pb id=\"p.201\"/>that Sextus Tarquinius was seized with a wicked desire<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 534-510</note> to debauch Lucretia by force; not only her beauty, but her proved chastity as well, provoked him.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"11\"/> However, for the present they ended the boyish prank of the night and returned to the camp.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"chapter\" n=\"58\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>When a few days had gone by, Sextus Tarquinius, without letting Collatinus know, took a single attendant and went to Collatia.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> Being kindly welcomed, for no one suspected his purpose, he was brought after dinner to a guest-chamber. Burning with passion, he waited till it seemed to him that all about him was secure and everybody fast asleep; then, drawing his sword, he came to the sleeping Lucretia. Holding the woman down with his left hand on her breast, he said, <quote>Be still, Lucretia! I am Sextus Tarquinius. My sword is in my hand. Utter a sound, and you die!</quote> In affright the woman started out of her sleep.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> No help was in sight, but only imminent death. Then Tarquinius began to declare his love, to plead, to mingle threats with prayers, to bring every resource to bear upon her woman\\'s heart.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> When he found her obdurate and not to be moved even by fear of death, he went farther and threatened her with disgrace, saying that when she was dead he would kill his slave and lay him naked by her side, that she might be said to have been put to death in adultery with a man of base condition.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> At this dreadful prospect her resolute modesty was overcome, as if with force, by his victorious lust; and Tarquinius departed, exulting in his conquest of a woman\\'s honour. Lucretia, grieving at her great disaster, dispatched the same message to her father in Rome and to her husband at Ardea: <pb id=\"p.203\"/>that they should each take a trusty friend and come;<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 534-510</note> that they must do this and do it quickly, for a frightful thing had happened. Spurius Lucretius came with Publius Valerius, Volesus\\' son.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> Collatinus brought Lucius Junius Brutus, with whom he chanced to be returning to Rome when he was met by the messenger from his wife. Lucretia they found sitting sadly in her chamber. The entrance of her friends brought the tears to her eyes, and to her husband\\'s question, <quote>Is all well?</quote>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/> she replied, <quote>Far from it; for what can be well with a woman when she has lost her honour? The print of a strange man, Collatinus, is in your bed. Yet my body only has been violated; my heart is guiltless, as death shall be my witness. But pledge your right hands and your words that the adulterer shall not go unpunished. Sextus Tarquinius is he that last night returned hostility for hospitality, and armed with force brought ruin on me, and on himself no less &mdash;if you are men &mdash;when he worked his pleasure with me.</quote>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"8\"/> They give their pledges, every man in turn. They seek to comfort her, sick at heart as she is, by diverting the blame from her who was forced to the doer of the wrong.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"9\"/> They tell her it is the mind that sins, not the body; and that where purpose has been wanting there is no guilt.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"10\"/> <quote>It is for you to determine,</quote> she answers, <quote>what is due to him; for my own part, though I acquit myself of the sin, I do not absolve myself from punishment; not in time to come shall ever unchaste woman live through the example of Lucretia.</quote>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"11\"/> Taking a knife which she had concealed beneath her dress, she plunged it into her heart, and sinking forward upon the wound, died as she fell.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"12\"/> The wail for the dead was raised by her husband and her father.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> <pb id=\"p.205\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"chapter\" n=\"59\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>Brutus, while the others were absorbed in<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 534-510</note> grief, drew out the knife from Lucretia\\'s wound, and holding it up, dripping with gore, exclaimed, <quote>By this blood, most chaste until a prince wronged it, I swear, and I take you, gods, to witness, that I will pursue Lucius Tarquinius Superbus and his wicked wife and all his children, with sword, with fire, aye with whatsoever violence I may; and that I will suffer neither them nor any other to be king in Rome!</quote> The knife he then passed to Collatinus, and from him to Lucretius and Valerius.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> They were dumbfounded at this miracle. Whence came this new spirit in the breast of Brutus? As he bade them, so they swore. Grief was swallowed up in anger; and when Brutus summoned them to make war from that very moment on the power of the kings, they followed his lead.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/> They carried out Lucretia\\'s corpse from the house and bore it to the market-place, where men crowded about them, attracted, as they were bound to be, by the amazing character of the strange event and its heinousness.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"4\"/> Every man had his own complaint to make of the prince\\'s crime and his violence. They were moved, not only by the father\\'s sorrow, but by the fact that it was Brutus who chid their tears and idle lamentations and urged them .to take up the sword, as befitted men and Romans, against those who had dared to treat them as enemies.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"5\"/> The boldest of the young men seized their weapons and offered themselves for service, and the others followed their example. Then, leaving Lucretia\\'s father to guard Collatia, and posting sentinels so that no one might announce the rising to the royal family, the rest, equipped for battle and with Brutus in command, set out for Rome.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"6\"/> Once there, wherever their armed <pb id=\"p.207\"/>band advanced it brought terror and confusion; but.<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 534-510</note> again, when people saw that in the van were the chief men of the state, they concluded that whatever it was it could be no meaningless disturbance.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"7\"/> And in fact there was no less resentment at Rome when this dreadful story was known than there had been at Collatia. So from every quarter of the City men came running to the Forum. No sooner were they there than a crier summoned the people before the Tribune of the Celeres,<note>For the <hi rend=\"italics\">Celeres,</hi> see xv. 8 and note. H. J. Edwards (<hi rend=\"italics\">ad</hi> <hi rend=\"italics\">loc.</hi>) thinks that the office comprised both military and civil functions-the command of the cavalry (<hi rend=\"italics\">cf.</hi> the <hi rend=\"italics\">Magister</hi> <hi rend=\"italics\">Equitum</hi> in republican times) and the presidency (as deputy of the king) of comitia and senate.</note> which office Brutus then happened to be holding.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"8\"/> There he made a speech by no means like what might have been expected of the mind and the spirit which he had feigned up to that day. He spoke of the violence and lust of Sextus Tarquinius, of the shameful defilement of Lucretia and her deplorable death, of the bereavement of Tricipitinus, in whose eyes the death of his daughter was not so outrageous and deplorable as was the cause of her death.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"9\"/> He reminded them, besides, of the pride of the king himself and the wretched state of the commons, who were plunged into ditches and sewers and made to clear them out. The men of Rome, he said, the conquerors of all the nations round about, had been transformed from warriors into artisans and stone-cutters.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"10\"/> He spoke of the shameful murder of King Tullius, and how his daughter had driven her accursed chariot over her father\\'s body, and he invoked the gods who punish crimes against parents.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"11\"/> With these and, I fancy, even fiercer reproaches, such as occur to a man in the very presence of an outrage, but are far from easy for an historian to reproduce, he inflamed the people, and brought them to abrogate the king\\'s authority and to exile Lucius Tarquinius, together with his wife and children.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"12\"/> Brutus himself then enrolled the juniors, who <pb id=\"p.209\"/>voluntarily gave in their names, and arming them<note type=\"margin\">B.C. 534-510</note> set out for the camp at Ardea to arouse the troops against the king. The command at Rome he left with Lucretius, who had been appointed Prefect of the City by the king, some time before.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"13\"/> During this confusion Tullia fled from her house, cursed wherever she went by men and women, who called down upon her the furies that avenge the wrongs of kindred.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"chapter\" n=\"60\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"1\"/>When the news of these events reached the camp, the king, in alarm at the unexpected danger, set out for Rome to put down the revolt. Brutus, who had perceived the king\\'s approach, made a circuit to avoid meeting him, and at almost the same moment, though by different roads, Brutus reached Ardea and Tarquinius Rome.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"2\"/> Against Tarquinius the gates were closed and exile was pronounced. The liberator of the City was received with rejoicings in the camp, and the sons of the king were driven out of it. Two of them followed their father, and went into exile at Caere, in Etruria. Sextus Tarquinius departed for Gabii, as though it had been his own kingdom, and there the revengers of old quarrels, which he had brought upon himself by murder and rapine, slew him.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p><milestone unit=\"section\" n=\"3\"/>Lucius Tarquinius Superbus ruled for five and twenty years. The rule of the kings at Rome, from its foundation to its liberation, lasted two hundred and forty-four years. Two consuls were then chosen in the centuriate comitia, under the presidency of the Prefect of the City, in accordance with the commentaries of Servius Tullius.<note>The <quote>consuls,</quote> as they were called from the time of the Decemvirate, were originally designated <quote>praetors</quote>; Livy is anachronistic. The <quote>centuriate comitia</quote> was the assembly of the people by centuries, as classified by Servius, primarily for military ends. It is more likely that Lucretius presided over the election in the capacity of interrex (to which office Dion. iv. 84 says Lucretius was appointed by Brutus) than in that of prefect.</note> These were Lucius Junius Brutus and Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p> <pb id=\"p.211\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div1>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div1 type=\"book\" n=\"1s\"><head>Summary of book I</head>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p><hi rend=\"italics\">A.</hi> Arrival of Aeneas in Italy and his deeds.

He\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tadded a hundred members to the senate; subjugated the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tLatins; gave games in the circus; increased the centuries of knights; surrounded the city with a wall; made\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tsewers. He was killed by the sons of Ancus after ruling\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t38 years.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>His successor was Servius Tullius, son of a noblewoman, a captive from Corniculum. It is related that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twhen he was still a babe, lying in the cradle, his head\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tburst into flames. He conducted the first census and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tclosed the lustrum, and it is said that 80,000 were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tassessed. He enlarged the pomerium; added to the city\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Quirinal, Viminal, and Esquiline Hills; and with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Latins erected a temple to Diana on the Aventine.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHe was killed by Lucius Tarquinius, son of Priscus, on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe advice of his own daughter Tullia, after reigning\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t44 years.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>After him Lucius Tarquinius Superbus seized the kingdom, without the authorization of either Fathers or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPeople. He kept armed men about him to protect him.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHe waged war with the Volsci, and out of their spoils\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbuilt a temple to Jupiter on the Capitol. He brought\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tGabii under his sway by guile. When his sons had gone\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tto Delphi and were consulting the oracle as to which of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<pb id=\"p.215\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthem should be king in Rome, answer was made that he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tshould reign who should first kiss his mother. This\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tresponse the princes themselves explained otherwise, but\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tJunius Brutus, who had accompanied them, pretended to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tfall upon his face, and kissed the earth. And the outcome sanctioned his act. For when Tarquinius Superbus\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\thad brought all men to hate him by the violence of his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbehaviour, and finally Lucretia, whose chastity had been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tviolated at night by the king\\'s son Sextus, summoned her\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tfather Tricipitinus and her husband Collatinus and, adjuring them not to leave her death unavenged, killed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\therself with a knife, Tarquinius was expelled, chiefly\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthrough the efforts of Brutus, after a reign of 25 years.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThen the first consuls were chosen, Lucius Junius Brutus\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<pb id=\"p.219\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div1>\\n\\t\\t\\t'"

       "\"After a blockade of a few days the place surrendered the besiegers had not delivered any new attack but the Volsci had lost heart from the moment of their unsuccessful battle and the capture of their camp. Summary of book II BRUTUS bound the people with an oath to allow no one to reign in Rome. Tarquinius Collatinus his colleague who had incurred suspicion because of his relationship to the Tarquinii he forced to abdicate the consulship and withdraw from the state. He ordered the king's goods to be plundered and consecrated his land to Mars. It was named the Campus Martius. Certain noble youths—among them his own sons and his brother's—he beheaded because they had conspired to bring back the kings. To the slave who gave the information a man called Vindicius he gave his freedom from his name came the word vindicta. Having led an army against the princes who had collected forces from Veii and Tarquinii and begun a war he fell in the battle together with Arruns the son of Superbus and the matrons mourned for him a year. Publius Valerius the consul proposed a law about appealing to the people. The Capitol was dedicated. Porsenna king of Clusium made war in behalf of the Tarquinii and came to Janiculum but was prevented from crossing the Tiber by the bravery of Horatius Cocles who while the others were cutting down the Sublician Bridge kept the Etruscans at bay single-handed and when the bridge had been destroyed threw himself armed into the river and swam across to his fellows. Another example of courage was exhibited by Mucius. Having entered the camp of the enemy with the purpose of killing Porsenna he slew a secretary whom he had taken for the king. Being arrested he placed his hand upon the altar where sacrifice had been made and suffering it to be burned off declared that there were three hundred others as determined as himself. Overcome with astonishment at their daring Porsenna proposed terms of peace and having taken hostages relinquished the war. One of the hostages the maiden Cloelia evaded the sentinels and swam across the Tiber to her people. She was given up to Porsenna but was restored by him with marks of honour and was presented with an equestrian statue. Aulus Postumius the dictator fought a successful battle against Tarquinius Superbus who was advancing with an army of Latins. Appius Claudius came over from the Sabines to the Romans. On this account the Claudian tribe was added and the number of tribes was increased to twent-yone. The plebs after seceding to the Sacred Mount because of those who had been enslaved for debt were induced by the advice of Menenius Agrippa to cease from their rebellion. The same Agrippa when he died was buried owing to his poverty at the state's expense. Five plebeian tribunes were elected. The Volscian town of Corioli was captured by the valiant efforts of Gnaeus Marcius who acquired from this circumstance the name of Coriolanus. Titus Latinius a man of the plebs was warned in a dream to inform the senate regarding certain offences against religion. Having neglected to do it he lost a son and was paralysed in his feet. When he had been carried to the senate in a litter and had revealed these same matters he recovered the use of his feet and returned to his house. When Gnaeus Marcius Coriolanus who had been driven into exile and had been made general of the Volsci had led a hostile army nearly to Rome and when the envoys who had been sent to him at first and afterwards the priests had vainly besought him not to make war upon his native land his mother Veturia and his wife Volumnia persuaded him to withdraw. For the first time a land-law was proposed. Spurius Cassius the ex-consul charged with aspiring to be king was condemned and put to death. Opillia a Vestal Virgin was buried alive for unchastity. The neighbouring Veientes being a troublesome rather than a dangerous enemy the Fabian family asked to be allowed to carry on that war and dispatched thither 306 armed men who were all but one killed by the enemy at the Cremera. When Appius Claudius the consul had sustained a defeat at the hands of the Volsci owing to the contumacy of his army he caused every tenth soldier to be scourged to death. It contains besides campaigns against the Volsci the Hernici and the Veientes and the quarrels between the patricians and the plebs. Index of names (The References are to Pages.)
